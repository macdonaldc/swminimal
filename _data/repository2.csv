""Invitation Au Voyage: II"". Do you know that poem of Baudelaire's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q501]? It's something at the end of the world. He’s speaking to his beloved, very simple. You know, lots of the German Romanticism was very simple.

I'm going to read the ""The Imperatrice"". Ace of Pentacles is a card in the Tarot deck, but the book should be called ‘pente’ which all the words that appeared in a hypnagogic vision, hypnagogic is the state between waking and sleeping, it's what Jung [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41532] practiced and his Marie Louise Franz would take down the things that came to him in the state between waking and sleeping and the letters ‘pente’ appeared in that state and I didn't know what they meant so I kept hunting around and I made the word 'pinnacles' out of it and somebody said why don't you call it ""Ace of Pinnacles"" and we made a whole thing about the Tarot deck, but that's not the title of the book. It should be ‘pente’ and that's from the Greek  which is ‘wall’. And I'd like have as a fronts piece for the book William Blake's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513] ""The Chimney Sweep""  [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2587725] the second version of that from the ""Songs of Experience"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27890603] when he says that my mum and father have gone up to the church to pray and they make a heaven of my misery. That kind of thing. Imperatrice there's another card from the Tarot deck it's the third card of the deck.

There is something else I thought I'd like to read after that one. I'll read a poem for Sylvia Plath [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133054] who was an American poet who married an English man, Ted Hughes [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q272194] and had mental troubles and wrote a novel about it called The Bell Jar [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1213085] under a pseudonym Victoria Lucas, so not to embarrass her mother, and then things became too much for her and I think in 1963, she did away with herself in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84], and it was a great loss, some people feel that and some do not, they feel that at least--Lowell has written an introduction to her poems posthumously printed called Ariel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q224733] and her first book was The Colossus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29889462]. But Victoria Lucas was, The Bell Jar, was, you could buy it through William Hiderman and it came down from Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] to the United States and it's never been printed in the country. This is ""The Suicide"".

Maybe we'll have one more, or is that anything from that first reading that you'd like to hear again? I'd rather not go into it. [Unknown audience member suggests poem. Title unintelligible]. Okay, that's what Spender [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q448764] did say to me, he said you look like a de-frocked priest, so.

One moment... problem that we have here at Sir George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342]. We did try to get a larger hall but it was impossible. To accommodate the overflow, we have set up loudspeakers in the little gallery here, Howard, and in the other one too?

Because this, this is a gallery which belongs to the Fine Arts department, we had great difficulty getting it, these paintings are very precious, particularly to the artists themselves [audience laughter]. I would ask you please to stay away from the paintings. That must have been the artist [audience laughter]. We are also waiting for the arrival of someone else, so please be patient. Howard--[audience laughter] can you ask the security people to turn on the cooling system, the hall is going to be too hot.

Wynne Francis
00:05:19
[Laughter]. Miss Atwood [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183492] has just upstaged the introducer. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It's not often that an artist excels in two medium such as poetry and fiction as our guest tonight does. Miss Atwood's reputation as a superior poet was established in the 60's with her first collections, The Circle Game [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7723073] and The Animals in that Country [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7713834]. And while continuing to write fine poetry, six major collections to date, she's given  us two novels in the last five years, The Edible Woman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7731579] and Surfacing. With the second novel, published late in 1972, within a few months of a controversial work of criticism, Margaret Atwood became one of Canada's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] best known literary artists. The hypothesis of Survival, a study of patterns in Canadian lit is that Canadians see themselves as victims. I was remind of Survival recently when I came across a nineteenth-century curiosity written by one John McTaggart [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463553]. It was a book published in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84] in 19-- excuse me--1829. McTaggart wrote ""There's a melancholy which is peculiar to Canadians which must be combatted. People who labor under it must be encouraged, the soothing language, good treatment and now and then as circumstances require, a little assistance gratis as a stimulant."" McTaggart's third point about the helpful effects of a little assistance as a recent theory has been taken up by the Canada Council [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2993809], to whom we are in part indebted for her appearance tonight. Margaret Atwood's work constitutes an exploration of what it means to be a Canadian, to be a woman and to be a human being. She writes about our totems, our tapestry of manners, our progressive insanities. She taught at Sir George in 67-68, and it's a great pleasure to have her return to us tonight. After her reading, she'll be open to questions from the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Margaret Atwood.

Let's see now, if the mic starts to get funny, let me know...Too loud?...Not too loud, I'm afraid it isn't a very good mic and also I'm afraid I'm going to have to hold it the whole time which is a bore...I don't think it'll work very well, is that better? Does that work? Higher? Lower? Okay, how's that? Okay, I'm going to read entirely from my new book which is called ""This is""--oh, what is it called? [audience laughter]. It's called You Are Happy. Somebody who has been photographing me says that a friend of hers was in a bookstore and picked out this book and thought at first that this was one of these ""I'm Okay, You're Okay"" books. Until I saw who wrote it. [Audience laughter]. But it has a happy ending, you'll be pleased to know. And I'm going to begin at the beginning and end at the end. Skipping portions along the way. I'm also going to make this reading fairly short because we are all in this rather constricted situation. I used to tell people when people in the States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] used to ask me “do you live in an igloo” and other questions like that, I used to think to myself that being a Canadian was sort of like living in a chicken coop in the middle of the desert. That everybody was all together in one place but there are these huge spaces around. I wish that  we had been provided with one of them. [Audience laughter]. I have a chicken coop, and you're nicer. But there are more of you. I think we will all have to be very, very patient, unlike the chickens. I'm going to begin by reading a poem called ""Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad"".

How did your nickname of a witch get originated?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:37:30
How did my nickname of a witch? Are you referring to the speech I gave the other night at Loyola? Oh, it's, I was talking about a couple of reviews, that seemed to credit me with having these supernatural powers, you know, the ability to hypnotize my readers and things like that, and what I was saying was that in fact I don't in fact possess the powers of hypnotism or I'd use them on my bank manager and be quite rich. Um, I was talking about a pattern that seems to crop up from time to time in a certain kind of review usually written by men. [Audience laughter]. I heard that there were a couple of people in the audience at Loyola who before the speech, were convinced that I was a witch and that I was going to talk about witchcraft, and when I said that I wasn't one, they left. [Audience laughter]. You see, if I were a witch, I wouldn't be able to wear the cross. So that's how you can tell I'm not. Wards off vampires. Um, yes?
 
Audience Member 2
00:38:54
Um, [unintelligible] and as well as the Edible Woman, I seem to get this idea of an emergence from greyness, or darkness and I was wondering if it's through this emergence from greyness that you have any reference to Blake [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513] in his emergence from chaos.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:39:17
I'll be very flattered, if I did. I'm afraid I suffer by the comparison. I think that you're right in spotting it, I think I would say that it's more like this, that if you want to think in terms of colour, that you start with a grey, and then you go down. Down into, well, it depends on the poem or the book or whatever of what's happening in your life. And, but you have to go down before you come up again otherwise you stay just in the grey part. If you want a real pattern for this, it's Dante's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1067] Inferno [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4509219], where the man starts in a wandering wood, you know he starts in a kind of state of being lost, and then he goes down into hell. The further down he goes the more tortured souls he sees, but when he gets right to the bottom he finds that he's going up again. And then he comes out the other side.
 
Audience Member 2
00:40:19
Yeah, but, in this other side-ness in the Edible Woman you come up through colours, a very [unintelligible] of colours and I was wondering if this is the complete emergence of man?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:40:29
Not complete--I would say no, no beginning.
 
Audience Member 2
00:40:32
[Unintelligible] complete--into his universal aspect, but into an emergence of man. Into the colours of life.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:40:39
Your choice of the word 'man' is interesting. Since the heroine is a woman. [Audience laughter and applause]. Um, I think you have the pattern right. I wouldn't like to attach any sort of universal meaning to it.
 
Audience Member 2
00:40:56
No I'm not attaching a universal meaning, I'm attaching more or less a universal meaning to the colour of darkness or greyness.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:41:04
No, that's right, you're correct. Yes.
 
Audience Member 2
00:41:07
I'm not trying to express a universal meaning into these colours, this is where you're taking it wrong.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:41:14
Well, I'm not too sure what we're talking about  to tell you the truth. You've spotted a correct pattern and I'm not too sure how one interprets it because I don't like to be the critic of  my own work in a way if you know what I mean. Yes.
 
Audience Member 3
00:41:34
I know you're writing a screenplay for [unintelligible]. Will it ever become a film?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:41:39
Will it ever? Let's see now, I finished it at the end of July. Now, what is--the stages of making a film are these: first somebody takes out an option on it, which means they pay you X dollars to have the sole right to try to make the movie for a certain period of time. If they fail to make it to renew the option or to require the rights at the end of that period, you get it back and you can then sell it to anybody else or back to them if you want. That's different from buying the rights which means they've got it. And you can't get it back. An option has been taken out, a script has been written. They are now doing whatever it is they do, who knows. To try to put together what is called a package, that is, they try to interest a director or they pick out a director and they try to put a director together with a script together with some money. And that's all going on, I don't know what's happening with it because they don't tell. Yes.
 
Audience Member 4
00:42:42
Are those people American or Canadian?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:42:47
These people are. [Audience laughter]. Once upon a time there was an English Canadian film industry. Not very hard. I mean it's trying very hard but not many results are being had. And I wanted very much to make Surfacing in Canada with Canadian everything, but I was about two years too late. And also Canadians are quite timmerus about this book because they said “well, it'll never be able to sell a film in the States” because of all that strange American symbolism in it. They--the two people I'm working with are two American independent producers, not to be confused with MGM [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179200], who want to make the book as it is, that is, they like the book, they want to be faithful to it, they don't want to transport it to Maine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q724] or wherever and make it into an American film, which of course you couldn't do without ruining the symbolic pattern. They want to make it in Canada, they want to put in all that stuff because they say “wow, dynamite”. [Audience laughter]. They're not worried about selling it in the States. So that's how we're proceeding right now and we have not yet had a falling out on any of the crucial matters such as what's in the screenplay. And so that's been fine. They would like to make it here. And what stage they're at right now I don't know. Now if they don't put it together, then I get it back and then I have another go. And I'll try it ‘round Canada again, once more, and I'll probably with the same results--
 
Audience Member 4
00:44:26
You have tried?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:44:30
Oh yes, everybody tries. I've written four or five screenplays, none of them have been made. They've all been for Canadians. One thing has happened, I got one television play done, but of course everything you do for the CBC [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461761] pretty well gets done. [Audience laughter]. As you know. I wrote a screenplay for Edible Woman that didn't get done. I wrote one for Marie-Claire Blais [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298358], Mad Shadows, we had high hopes for that, that was a Canadian director, Canadian producer all the rest of it. No deal. Film development corporations said it wasn't commercial enough. I mean, you don't go outside before you've been through it for a while. It's a problem that novelists used to face when trying to get their novels published here.
 
Wynne Francis
00:45:22
I'd like to ask a question, and I can't see what competition I've got, I can't see anything out there. On Wednesday at Loyola, you gave comic tags to some of your critical opponents taken from Koestler [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q78494], Yogis and Komisars are critics that are formalists and culturally and politically aware and I wondered, do you see the ideal critic or type of criticism as combining these two?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:45:51
Well, I think that people have certain talents, you know, and they should exercise what talents they have, and that all kinds of criticism should be available to the reader. I don't think that every critic has to do everything, I think that would be asking a singer to be a dancer. 
 
Wynne Francis
00:46:08
I remember you saying it was good to have both kinds, I wondered if you think they could be combined?

Is it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing body?
 
Margaret Atwood

Is it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing body? Um, I'll let you answer that. If such a person could do it, I'd like to see it, I've never seen anybody who could do both at the same time. Frye [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q354256], for instance, does one kind in one book and then another kind in another book, but he usually doesn't usually do them both in the same book. I would say that Yogi-ism is necessary to be able to read a poem, just period pure and simple. To see what is happening in it. But Komasarism is necessary to place it in a larger context. Why not do both? Yes, I see. Back there, you

Do you think that Quebec [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q176] is a part of Canada?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:47:09
Oh that's such a good question.
 
Audience Member 6
00:47:11
Do you think that a Quebecois is a Canadian?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:47:15
I think I'll leave that to the Quebecois to decide for themselves. They're the people concerned. [Audience applause]. I was talking with one not so long ago, Marie-Claire Blais, and I asked her that question. I said, “well, what do you think of yourself as? Do you think of yourself as a Quebecoise? or a Canadian? or a North-American, or part of Western European culture or a universalist?” And she said, “I am from Quebec”. [Audience laughter]. Does that answer your question? Yes.
 
Audience Member  7
00:47:58
What is your opinion of the introductions in the New Canadian Library [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16998703] Series?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:48:03
Well, they vary. [Audience laughter]. Do you mean the one? Well, I thought that it was, it was like a, well, the only thing I can think of is something fairly vulgar, um, but I don't mean that I think it was bad. I mean that I think it was quite a ponderous organization, being brought to bear on what I consider to be a fairly light piece of writing. That is, at the front of my book, I have a quotation from the Joy of Cooking which tells how to make puff pastry. And then I have you know, critical sort of, really big critical apparatus coming in and talking about the symbolic structuring and the this and the that, and I think it's nice, I'm glad to know about those things, but [audience laughter] it's somehow, I thought my novel was a bit more comic than that. If you know what I mean.
 
Audience Member 8
00:49:09
Yeah, I wanted to ask a question. Yeah, I was wondering to what degree you consider yourself to be an ironist because you're talking about [unintelligible] irony, it seems to me that irony is the point I’m most attracted to in your work anyway.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:49:22
Yeah, well, you can have both of course, as a matter of fact you usually do.
 
Audience Member 8
00:49:31
You were talking about anger, and ""permit me the present tense"" kind of thing, seems to me that that was ironic.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:49:41
Ambigu--it has a double meaning. But that's not always irony, I think irony has been...Well, somebody defined irony as a kind of literature in which the reader knows more about what's going on with the character than the character knows himself, shall we say. So, yes, of course, I think that happens in an awful lot of modern literature. Yes.
 
Audience Member 9
00:50:14
I understand you're working on Survival Two?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:50:16
Not working, exactly.
 
Audience Member 9
00:50:22
I was wondering whether you could, or would like to elaborate on that.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:50:25
Yeah, okay. There was to have been something called Survival Two, which was to have been this really dynamite anthology. Which would have incorporated many of the short pieces mentioned in Survival, plus other ones that were appropriate and we did assemble this and then we had it priced as to how much it would cost for permissions and how much it would cost us to print it and it was just astronomically expensive. So we had to shelf that, and that was what Survival Two was to have been. Now I'll probably publish the proposed table of contents sometime and you can see what would have been in it. [Audience laughter]. You know, but a small publisher cannot afford to do this kind of thing. However, I am, I won't say working on because I'm working on it in the same sense that I'm working on my Ph.D. thesis, what I'm really doing is writing a novel. But I will, should I live that long, write a second edition of Survival, in which I hope to have five new chapters and additions to the ones that already exist. I think the thing about Survival that sometimes gets forgotten was that it was based on what was available in paperback at the time. A lot more things are available in paperback now, we have General Publishing coming on the scene, with Paper Jacks,  and New Canadian Library expanding itself and Macmillan's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2108217] paperbacks expanding. So there's just a lot more around that you can put in and also new books have been published that I would like to talk about and I've discovered older ones that I didn't know about before. So, all of these things, plus a new introduction and maybe a few things at the back, I would like to do. However, I'm not quite ready to do it yet. I took a kind of holiday after I finished Survival One, and I'm still in that, it's a holiday devoted to writing other things. Yes,

00:52:30
Who are your favourite poets?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:52:33
I tend to have favourite poems, rather than favourite poets, but I can tell you the names of some people who've written some of my favourite poems. One of them is Margaret Avison [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6759152], one of them is P.K. Page [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2755960], they're poems by all kinds of people that I really like, for instance, I really like some of A.M. Klein's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2778027] poems. I think they're just super. And more modern people, for instance, Michael Ondaatje [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313593], I like his work, Al Purdy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4704621] I was reading in the early to middle Sixties, Doug Jones [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5203595] at that time. It covers a very wide range. I'm a kind of omnivorous reader, I'll read anything, including the backs of Cornflake boxes, so that you just never know, and it also changes, you know, because you read somebody for a while and then you've done that so you go and read somebody else.

Audience Member 10
00:53:31
[Unintelligible].

Margaret Atwood
00:53:33
Oh yeah, I get various little magazines come floating in through the mail to me, for some reason. And right now, for instance, I'm reading a lot of Adrienne Rich [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270705], because I'm about to write a review of her latest book. This kind of thing, I mean it varies from month to month. If you ask me the same question in January the question would be different...Yeah.
 
Audience Member 11
00:54:02
[Unintelligible] Is Surfacing more than vaguely autobiographical?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:54:11
It's vaguely, if you're talking about the plot--no. The setting, yes, and this is generally true of fiction, that people write from a setting that they know. They generally create characters out of some people that they've known plus they throw things in and invent them and make mosaics out of various things and the characters are fictional. The plot is usually a total invention. I mean, my parents are still alive and well, all of that. No, I have never been a paranoid schizophrenic with amnesia. [Audience laughter]. And as for the Edible Woman, I've never gone off food, but all kinds of other people have. You know, they come up to me and say, “Gee, how did you know the story of my life” and “that's happened to me and let me tell you it was awful, I used to throw up on busses”. I was kind of shocked, actually, I thought it was all a big comic invention of my own. I see one waving at the back.
 
Audience Member 12
00:55:20
Um, excuse me, would you say that you base your characters on some type of psychological background?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:55:25
Um, I try to make them believable insofar as it will fit the plot. That is, I try to make what they do believable to myself, but they have to do what they do if you see what I mean. Yes.
 
Audience Member 13
00:55:46
Would you say the Edible Woman is a comical invention of your own?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:55:49
I said I thought it was, yeah.
 
Audience Member 13
00:55:51
Well, how would you define that, as a comedy?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:55:54
Oh, okay, if you wanna be technical. Um, the Edible Woman is actually an anti-comedy. Because a comedy is a form in which usually a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings and gets married at the end. Now in the Edible Woman, a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings and somebody else gets married at the end. [Audience laughter]. Yes. 
 
Audience Member 14
00:56:24
Could you tell us anything about the novel you're writing now?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:56:26
Not a thing, that's my one superstition--well, it's one of my superstitions. I can't talk about work that I'm doing, it uses up the energy. It's true. Yeah.
 
Audience Member 15
00:56:41
I read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q545375], about [unintelligible].
 
Margaret Atwood
00:56:49
Okay, the question is I read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies, Fifth Business [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5447489]?
 
Audience Member 15
00:56:58
No, an earlier book.

00:57:01
Oh, okay.
 
Audience Member 15
00:57:02
About a couple in a town [unintelligible] resolve it and they get married. And I wondered why he wasn't mentioned in Survival at all.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:57:15
Well, I think probably because I wasn't doing humour and I wasn't doing magic. But since I am doing humour and magic in the next two chapters, then he will be in those. Samuel Marchbanks [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7412104] will be in under humour and Fifth Business and Manticore will be in under magic. I find the magician figure in Fifth Business very interesting from this particular advantage point. Why do Canadian magicians have to disguise themselves as foreigners in order to be thought of as magic. [Audience laughter.] You find this in Gwen MacEwen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4276487] too. Specifically in the book called No Man.
 
Audience Member 16
00:58:04
Is that a novel?
 
Margaret Atwood
00:58:04
It is a series of short stories, but there's sort of a central one in which you have the same pattern. Okay, let's have one more if there is one more. There isn't one more, there's one more.
 
Audience Member 17
00:58:22
Um, the poems that you read tonight, would you consider those the best or the most significant ones from your collection, and if neither of those things, why did you select the ones that you read? The reason that I've asked that is because I've read your latest book quite carefully and I think that you read the, some of the best poems from it. I was wondering if you thought they were some of the best poems.
 
Margaret Atwood
00:58:45
Yeah. I think that one of the best things in it is section number three, but that consists of twenty four poems, which seem to me to be too long. I read some of them that I like quite a lot, yes, this is true, but I left out some others that I also like quite a lot because it seemed to me that they were too long and at this particular night anyway I felt that I should get through as quickly as possible because we were all stifling to death. Um, and with that I think that I will now end the question period and we can all go out and have a drink of water. 

Audience
00:59:24
Applause [cuts out briefly].

Introducer
00:00:00
On behalf of the Poetry Reading Committee of this university, Mr. Roy Kiyooka [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789], Mrs. Wynne Francis, Mr. Howard Fink, Mr. Irving Layton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1673289], and Mr. Stanton Hoffman, I wish to welcome you to the second reading in our fall series. The reader for this evening is Mr. Anthony Hecht [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3618497] of New York City [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60]. Mr. Hecht was born in New York City. He is a fellow of the American Academy in Rome [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463271]. He is the author of two volumes of poetry, A Summoning of Stones, which was published by Macmillan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2108217] in New York City in 1954, and a later volume published in Northampton, Massachusetts [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49186] in 1958, Seven Deadly Sins. Mr. Hecht is a poetry editor of The Hudson Review [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15708605]. Mr. Hecht has also been a faculty member of such universities as Smith [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49204], New York University [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49210] and Bard College [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49109], and he will be joining the faculty of the University of Rochester [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q149990] very soon. Mr. Hecht is the author of three forthcoming volumes: The Hard Hours, which is to be published soon by Viking [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q921536], a volume called Double Dactyls, which is to appear about Christmas and is to be published by Atheneum [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4813415], and a volume of verse epigrams to the engravings of Thomas Bewick [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q437594], which is to be published by the Harvard University Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1587900]. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Anthony Hecht. 
 
Anthony Hecht
00:01:36
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here, this is my first trip to Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16], and I regret that it should be so brief. I must leave tomorrow, but I'm struck by the frigidity of the weather and the warmth of the greeting that I received upon arriving. I'd like to begin with a poem which I'll, is set in Italy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38], where I spent quite a while. It's called ""A Hill"", and it's what...about a purported visionary experience. 
 
Anthony Hecht
00:02:21
Reads ""A Hill"" from The Hard Hours..
 
Anthony Hecht
00:04:50
The next is called ""A Letter"". Some of these, I think, will require some sort of explanatory comment from me, but I don't think this will.

Anthony Hecht
00:06:44
The next is called ""The Vow"". I should say that all the poems that I want to read to you this evening are from a book called The Hard Hours. They...the book is, I fear, for better or for worse, somewhat on the grim side, as the title is meant to indicate. It perhaps is a corrective to the abundant cheerfulness of my first book. But I hope that there were a few light moments here and there. This one, on the other--is somewhat grim. It is in fact about a miscarriage. And I had better explain to you that a large part of the second stanza, and all of the third stanza is spoken by the ghost of the child who fails to be born. It is called ""The Vow"".
 
Anthony Hecht
00:07:42

Anthony Hecht
00:10:01
The next one is also somewhat on the grim side, but it requires an appeasing little note of explanation. Its title is ""More Light! More Light!"" which purport to be the last words of Goethe [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5879] on his deathbed. There's been a good deal of discussion and dispute as to quite what he meant at the time, which may simply have been to raise the shade. But inasmuch as he is regarded as the spirit of the German Enlightenment, a great deal more profound significance is normally attached to those words. He plays a very minor, somewhat ghostly role in this poem, which is a deliberate and violent contrast, so violent, indeed, that the poem was rejected by The New Yorker [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217305] on the grounds that the contrast was much too violent for their taste. Between an execution, which is in fact a conflation I've made myself of several executions that took place in England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21] during the Renaissance [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4692], and an execution that took place in the Buchenwald concentration camp [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152802] during the Second World War [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q362], and the details of which I got from a book by Eugene Kogan, who was himself a prisoner there for five years and survived, miraculously, and was then flown to England to help draw up the indictments that were used, [coughs], excuse me, at the Nuremberg Trials [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80130]. Goethe's role, his ghostly role in this, is explained by the fact that most prisoners who were brought to Buchenwald were brought by train, and there was no railroad station there at the camp, so the prisoners were, disembarked at the nearest railroad station, which was Weimar [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3955], and they walked the rest of the way from there.

Anthony Hecht
00:14:36
The next is a little lighter, gratefully. But it has its gruesome aspects too, as a matter of fact. It is called ""The Man Who Married Magdalen: Variation on a Theme by Louis Simpson"". Louis Simpson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1871997], a fine poet and very old friend of mine. A road poem in one of his early books, called ""The Man Who Married Magdalen"", a fine and delicate poem, in which he imagines that this man who raged and stormed throughout his married life, upon the death of his wife finds it in his heart to forgive her and to acknowledge his abiding love for her. In fact, if I can remember the last stanza, it goes, ""But when he woke, and woke alone, he wept and would deny the loose behaviour of the bone, and the immodest thigh"". I have chosen to make him far less forgiving in my version. He is a very angry man, and the whole poem takes place in a bar where he has been releasing his anger in a bibulous way for some time. His anger is not only personal, however, it's also theological. He is someone who believes in and accepts the ancient dispensation according to which Mary Magdalene [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q63070] had done something which could not, in fact, be so easily forgiven. And he regards the new dispensation as an antinomian heresy which leaves him bewildered and accounts for the rather promiscuous behaviour he finds all around him in the bar. I ought to tell you also that I went on a reading tour of New England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18389] a few years ago, and I planned to include this, but when I got to...it has some frankly dirty language in the second stanza, and I decided that it was unbecoming at certain colleges, [audience laughter], but I was assured by a friend of mine on the faculty at Wellesley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49205] that the girls there were tough, and they could take it.  [Audience laughter]. He liked it, and he thought I should read it. And indeed, I did. And nobody batted an eye. So, from then on, without compunction at all, I read it everywhere else, and when I got to Mount Hollyhock, [audience laughter], there I had every intention of reading it, but they were not only taping it, as you are here this evening, but they were taping it for radio broadcast, so I felt obliged to warn the Federal Communications Commission [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128831] [audience laughter] that this was the sort of thing that they would probably have to excise. And after the tour was over, I got a postcard from a friend of mine in that bastion of propriety, Boston [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100], saying that he had heard the whole broadcast with nothing cut out, so I take it there's absolutely nothing wrong with it now [audience laughter]. It has, in any case, a lofty epigraph from the Book of Jonah [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178819] [audience laughter], which says, ""Then said the Lord, 'Dost thou well, to be angry?'”

The poem I want to read next is also, again, on the somewhat grim side. It is, in fact, incomplete, but it stands altogether, by itself. It's going to be longer, but it is a unit, as it appears, or as I shall read it to you, and it's called, in its present state, ""The Rune"".
 
Anthony Hecht

Anthony Hecht
00:27:54
I guess a really violent change of pace is required, and I can provide it. But you are not to be spared as easily as that. There's another sort of wracking one that comes up in a minute. However, I can interject something in between. There's a little sort of period piece, a Restoration comedy song, sort of, called ""The Song of the Flea"". It was written...there were a group of poems that I wrote in collaboration with an artist. We did a bestiary together, and he did a whole bunch of very handsome lithographs of animals, and I wrote a few animal poems, and this is one of them.

00:29:40
Now this, this next, is quite frankly a stinker, I've got to warn you. It's a very unnerving poem. It's a colloquy; there are two voices, but I'm sure you'll have no difficulty telling them apart. There is one speaker who is a kind of compulsive talker, and he has a very patient and somewhat helpless auditor. The poem is called ""Behold the Lilies of the Field"".
 
Anthony Hecht

Reads ""Behold the Lilies of the Field"" from The Hard Hours.
 
Anthony Hecht
00:34:34
The next is a blessed relief. It's called ""Jason"", which is the name of my older son, and it's a poem written to celebrate his birth. He was born at the time I was teaching at Smith, and he was born on a Sunday, which has some bearing on the poem, but it conveniently avoided my, disrupting my academic obligations. And it has an epigraph from Doctor Faustus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50919], which goes, ""And from America, the Golden Fleece"".
 
Anthony Hecht

00:37:12
The next one is also, this is also rather cheery too--well, not really. I told you that I had gone on this New England tour a few years ago, and I began it in Maine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q724]. Well, I may have been misled [distortion], but I was told at the two or three colleges and universities where I read that Maine was a dry state, and I had so arranged my poems, completely unconsciously, that I had a whole bunch of them that all took place in bars, in bars altogether [audience laughter]. So I had the feeling as I was reading--I couldn't stop, you see, there I was-- after the third poem, I felt that I appeared to be an obsessive alcoholic. [Audience laughter]. This also takes place in a bar. I was born and brought up in New York City, and remember it from the time when Third Avenue had an elevator train that ran down its length. Now, that has all been torn down. But in the old days, not only did it have the elevator train, but it was lined on both sides all the way up and down with bars. The bars are still there. But the advantage of the El was that it cast a nice, gloomy shadow over the whole avenue even on the brightest days, so that you weren't obliged to face utter reality as soon as you stepped outside [audience laughter]. There was a sort of modulating gloom that you got out into. Now that's been torn down, and it's tougher than it was. The poem is called ""Third Avenue in Sunlight"".

00:40:31
There are two more poems I should like to read. The first of these is called ""Birdwatchers of America"". It has an epigraph from the journals of Baudelaire [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q501], very near the end of his life. Baudelaire wrote as follows: ""I suffer now continually from vertigo, and today, the 23rd of January, 1862, I received a singular warning. I felt the wind of the wing of madness pass over me"".

00:44:38
Finally, there is a poem that I must remind you of which I enormously admire, by Matthew Arnold [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271032]. ""Dover Beach"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5302469]. I have, in spite of my admiration for it, ventured to write a somewhat impertinent commentary upon it, which is called ""The Dover Bitch"" and subtitled [audience laughter], ""A Criticism of Life"", which is what Arnold said poetry ought to be.

...Read a couple of poems from a book that came out last year that's very hard to find, it's called Lectiones. These are poems that I offered in the book, very humbly, as poems that I think needed the instrumentation of the human voice, my voice, someone's voice to present them. I don't think they hold on paper. To some extent all of the poems that I've written, all of the poems anyone writes are scores for an eventual ideal performance in someone's mind's ear. More particularly in my poetry any kind of deviation from the margin represents a pitch variation, space left out indicates silence, in an obvious way, I don't know how better to do it, you know Yeats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213] played around with the notion of notation for songs, then he realized the words have to do with, I understand, two of the words must do it, but there are ways of setting them down. This is a poem called ""Dates of the Calendar"".

I'd like really, since I've read now tiny fragments, scatter of history, I'd like now for my good to read poems that are very recent, so everything that I read from here on after will be from the summer or after, this past summer. i.e. things that are still urgent with me that I have to deal with, as to say them or give. “King of Death”.

That's a very difficult poem for me. It's meant to sound difficult. I mean it's not meant to flow and it's filled with rhyme and I think rhyme is the torment. The real reason that rhyme was invented must have been pain, the pain of psychosis, the pain of madness, of hoping by that fictive and easy device to cling to a measure of order, because you can get cling, cling, ring, ring, ring the way the tantric hindus make their gestures of introjection, intro- substance via mantrum, rhyme noises, [unintelligible], they say. Fellini [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7371] makes fun of it in that 8 ½ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12018], the girl in the old Hindu...But I think rhyme is madness and rhyme is pain, and maybe poets will no longer have to be madmen now that we have come to abandon rhyme. Don't you think that free-verse poets are less mad then rhyming poets? [Audience laughter]. They need order somewhere else, they can't keep it there. Alright. I mean A.A. Milne [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207036] was probably the craziest man in the world. [Audience laughter]. This is a hard poem in a number of ways, the music of it interests me very much, it's a variety, it all fits on one page somehow but it's a long poem. It's based on the word ‘Gala’, the old Greek word for 'milk' from which we get obviously galactose and galactose but also galaxy from milky way, gala way.

This is, strange that I should say it, but this is the time of the world, you know, it is now upon us, when women can acquire souls. The whole of our culture is based on the soullessness of women, the woman gets soul from man, from children, from mother, but now perhaps woman is a separate entity, can be a separate entity, even if it means separate from me, but that is a large concern of mine. That's obvious from the poem, why do I have to say this. It comes of teaching and schools [audience laughter], that sort of thing, no one can understand a thing, nobody can understand anything, I can say it and say it again. Here's a poem, last spring, ""Memorial Day"". I looked out and saw the students of the college, oh, scattered on the lawn having a wiener roast or something.

I'd like to move back in time a little bit and read you a few sections from this very long poem called ""Weeks"", which is perhaps even going to be out even this month, sometime soon, I've just finished the proofs of it a week or so ago. Let me read you the first one, at any rate, this is not a narrative poem, but it is a continuity of poems, there are 150 sections, some of them are quite short and some of them are fairly long. So there is not what we are trying to call a formal similarity between the sections, there is a continuity of sound and of concern and that's enough.

It's deliberately a--what poems do at their beginnings is to set measures of music, to set new measures, not to declare more than the sound of themselves, I think that's important and a long poem might take a section or two or three or ten, in this case I think the first ten sections do no more than to set the measure of the poem. But I don't want to read them all. God, I don't want to read all 150 of them. I tried that once, not publicly, but I couldn't do it, even privately, even with coffee and the ability to s-m-o-k-e, can't do that here…[Audience laughter]. There is much said in this world about city, I mean I see all around me here the evidence of a monumental concern with city, and we're taught to think about Socrates [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q913] and polis and all of that--polis, city, the community of men, and we haven't said all that has to be said about it. In the last 100--the last 50 sections of ""Weeks"" I get very involved with that. I get very involved with the fact that we do build cities as we build rooms with no place to sit down, with no air, and so on and so forth, and the simplest way we can find that objectionable is simple: Animals, but in a different sense we have allowed that sense of community to destroy something that's closer to the bone, that possibility of a man's doing, and this is what experimental art is always about isn't it? A man doing his own work, that's the hardest experiment of all to do and to maintain, to continue doing your work and not somebody else's. So this is 107, it's about 'polis', the Greek word for 'city' if I am not pronouncing it clearly.

Now perhaps some of you are wondering what these readings are all about and how the choices made, I have here a slight commentary on that which I would like to read to you. Our answer to this is that we have not attempted to make the series an exhaustive coverage of any particular school or faction of poetry. Nor has our concern been an attempt to seek out the so-called ""great poets"". Our choices have been made with the desire to present to you, hopefully, the possibilities of utterance that is more than parochial. In short, this is our attempt to sound just that diversity that so much characterizes the North American Poetry scene. Now tonight it is my very great pleasure to introduce to you two poets whose distinctiveness is more than the fact of their sex. I want to introduce each poet in turn, Phyllis Webb [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7188637] will begin the readings and after the intermission, I shall introduce to you Gwendolyn MacEwen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4276487]. Now Phyllis Webb has published three books of poems, they are Even Your Right Eye in 1956, The Sea is Also a Garden in ‘62 and Naked Poems in ‘65. Her earlier work appeared in Trio along with Eli Mandel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3050883] and Gael Turnbull [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5516589]. She is currently a program organizer for CBC's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461761] Ideas Series [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5988057]. Ladies and Gentleman, Ms. Phyllis Webb.

This next poem is called ""Continuum"" and it's not a very extraordinary or terribly good poem even, I don't think, but it came out of a rather extraordinary experience, which was television. And it was simply a news clip from Vietnam [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q881], but this one had soundtrack on it, which made it rather more touching and inspired me to wire the Prime Minister. And shortly after that and I didn't know I was getting to the wire in the middle of it until I got there and it has to do with the almost totally impossibility of separating out objective events  that happen out there in history and in time and one's own private history.

I don't think I have the voice to read both sides of this poems tonight, there are two poems, one called ""Breaking"" and one called ""Making"". They're about the creative process that involves both those things, but ""Making"" is rather long and a little hard to read, so I'll read ""Breaking"" which is better probably as a poem.

The next poem is called ""The Time of Man"" and had a rather interesting genesis. I was reading an article in Horizon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3786777] by Dr. Loren Eiseley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2634723], which he was putting forward some ideas on evolution and it was very beautifully written this Dr. Eiseley's an excellent stylist as well as a good scientist and I discovered that as I was going through I was marking the sentences and a few days later I began writing a poem and picked up the book and listed the sentences, so this poem takes off from the Eiseley article which is called ""The Time of Man"" in which Eiseley says we must live evolution forward amongst many other interesting things and it is started with quotations, which you will get some of the time and some of the time you won't. I sent it to him for confirmation about the scientific aspects of it, he said okay, I used to write poetry too. ""The Time of Man"".

I want to read an old poem now, which I wrote in Dublin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1761], long years ago, if I can find it. It's called ""Poems of Dublin"", where I'd gone on a sort of literary pilgrimage in search of the spirit of Yeats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213] and Joyce [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6882] among others, it's a very down to earth sort of poem, in four parts.

Phyllis Webb
00:25:33
I want to move on now to my latest book called Naked Poems and which one of your local critics, or at least he wrote for the Montreal Star [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3521910] at this particular point, exclaimed of the price because there are so few words in the book. It's 2.25$. These poems are very small, and therefore very expensive and came at a bitter price, I may say, to me. They came quite as a surprise, I didn't know what I was doing when I wrote them, the first fourteen or so I thought, my goodness, what are these little things doing here, and I couldn't quite take them seriously and then I began to see the order that really was intrinsic in them, and realized that here was something, almost a new form for me to work on, and it's very bare, naked, undecorated and I wanted to get rid of all my affectations. And so I decided to write a couple hundred of them, and I wrote about a hundred and then got hung up on a technical problem, and finally reduced them to, I don't know, forty or so that are in this book. So this is a distillation, let's say. I'm going to read the first fourteen which comprise a total poem, in a sense the whole book is a poem. And then I'll read a few more as long as my voice and your patience will hold out. ""Suite I"".

One of the things I was interested in doing in these poems is again this subjective and the objective, here the subject and the object relationship, so that I use objects just to speak for themselves, in a sense, and yet they are all prismed in the way I see them. And again this impossibility of the dichotomy of subjective-objective.

Second half of our program...on the second half of our program we will have Gwendolyn MacEwen reading for us. I have notes in my hand concerning her, but on the back of this album, here, a CBC [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461761] publications release of...is it eight Canadian poets? One, two, three, four… [Audience laughter]. Yes, eight Canadian poets, this album is about to be released very shortly. There's a much more comprehensive biography of her, so I shall read this as an introduction to her. Born in Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172] in 1941, began publishing poetry in the Canadian Forum [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5030045] at age fifteen. She left school at eighteen, a high school dropout, as the sociologists would say [audience applause and laughter] to devote herself to writing. She has published three books of poetry, The Drunken Clock, The Rising Fire, and most recently, A Breakfast for Barbarians. She has also published a novel called Julian the Magician. In 1965, she was awarded the prize for poetry in the CBC's new writing contest. With the aid of a Canada Council [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2993809] grant, she is currently at work on a novel on the, how do you pronounce the guy's name? [whispers off-mic to MacEwen]...Pharaoh Akhenaten [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81794] [laughter] of the eighteenth dynasty in Egypt [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79].

So listen, I had a great idea that if our voices gave out we were just going to open up the record and bring a recorder up on a stage and place the needle in the proper groove, and then just let the record speak for itself.

Some people have asked me if that poem was about Toronto, and I'm at a loss to answer, not having seen horses, riders, chariots, or anything remotely similar in Toronto.

I recall Phyllis reading a poem on perhaps an evolutionary theme, and I have one here called ""The Heel"".

I think all poets should have some suffering poems, poems of great anguish. So feeling I was somewhat deficient in this area [audience laughter], I made use of a very opportune situation, recovering from an appendectomy in hospital. [Audience laughter]. Deciding that surely this was my moment, if I was ever going to write a painful poem it must be now. [Audience laughter]. So this is ""Appendectomy"".

Although I can't say that I'm convinced that that suffering was valid, either. But. The next poem is called ""The Self Assumes"", and I rarely talk about how a poem gets written because it seems mostly irrelevant, but I would remark that the last line of this poem was one of those very strange, surprising things that comes to one almost instantaneously, and one plucks it out of the air. I was very delighted with it. ""The Self Assumes"".

Which are also toward the end of Breakfast for Barbarians. Poems which, for me, represent a stage in my own growth as a poet. They are called the Arcanum poems, I believe they're on the record which Roy Kiyooka [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789] was showing you.

--want to start off this evening by reading a few poems from my earlier book, the one that Stan mentioned. These poems were written as a result of a summer in Japan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17], and they are very much occasional poems, they address themselves to the particular occasion of having been there, and they were meant in part to account for that experience of having been there, to my numerable friends in Vancouver. I'll begin by reading three very short little poems, they all relate to, what should we call it, the various contexts in which I saw the sculptured image of the Buddha. The first one is called ""Waiting Out the Rain"".

Now the next is a sequence of four little poems, very much like the traditional Japanese poems called the Haiku. This is a sequence, the title of which is ""The Stone Garden of Ryoanji"". The first one goes like this:

Now this one is called ""Children's Shrine"". Throughout most of the cities and towns and villages all over Japan you'll find way-side shrines, they're frequently just built into the wall in a very narrow street and people on whatever religious occasion come to worship there. This is a shrine particularly for children. And it goes like this:

00:17:07
I think I need to say a few words about this next group of poems, they were, they're from the book that I am having done at the moment, I started these poems in June 1965 in Montreal when I first came here. I don't know how to tell you this, except that at the time I came, I stayed with Alfred Pinsky [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21997094], or rather I stayed at his home, at his invitation, while I was looking for a place to live. Now, this took me about two weeks, it was very hot, and in the evenings I used to go through his library and pick up things and scanned them. One evening I came across this book, which was a biography of the English painter, Stanley Spencer [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1282413]. Spencer, we could say is perhaps the co-partner in the origin and the form and the content of this book. The book is in three parts, the first part is called the mirror, ""The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight"", and it is prefaced by a quotation from Spencer, which goes like this: ""I am meeting you all the time, and sending my longing for you into chaos, into the darkness, beyond these walls"". I may add that these poems, likewise, are on the whole, very brief, though some are longer.

There's a terrible draft coming in from the back, I think you're right Dick, we're going to end up with arthritic ankles. Well, this is the second section, and it is called ""The Proposal"". Once more, prefaced with a remark from Stanley Spencer, a very beautiful one. They are set down, as I found them in the book, I have used them in the context of this section of the book and these four poems, taken from his writings are meant to define certain of her attributes. Now I have given a title to each one of these four poems, and I hope they will clarify the context in which they belong here. ""Portrait of the Beloved"".

--and I were reading together, decided we should write one for the occasion, so we have each come up with a haiku. This is my haiku, it's especially for Dick. I have in brackets here, ""A gentle admonition to the audience following my reading, and preceding his"" and it goes like this: ""Let the stone tell how /snow-covered in whiteness, /these words, when his words come.""

The second reader of this evening, Dick Sommer, was born in St. Paul [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28848], Minnesota [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1527], and educated at the University of Minnesota [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238101] where he most recently returned as a visiting Assistant Professor of English, and at Harvard [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13371]. In 1958 he was a recipient of the Academy of American Poets [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q282096] Prize, and over a period of several years published his poems in the Harvard Advocate. He has given readings in Cambridge [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49111], Minneapolis [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36091], and in Oslo [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q585]. Also, he does not want me to mention his scholarly publications: Dash, Which Are, Strangers and Pilgrims, an essay on the Metaphor of the Journey written with Georg Roppen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23944662] and published by the Humanities Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q97958829] in New York City, as well as by the Norwegian University's Press, in Norway [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20] and A Monograph, the Odyssey and Primitive Religion, published by the University of Bergen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q204457] in 1962. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Dick Sommer.

I didn't want him to mention those. Oh I've got the deal with Roy, as well. So this is a haiku with, which you'll be glad to know also has seventeen syllables in the title. ""The Haiku to Roy Kiyooka"", in reply to his haiku to me.

And then there's the one that I think you have on that broadsheet, which as I looked at it, in all of its mimeographed splendor, struck me as sounding a bit, now, like the theme song of the Central Intelligence Agency [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37230], but I'm sorry about that, I didn't mean it that way when I wrote it.

Roy's given us a series of poems in praise of 'her', I don't know who 'her' is, but I have another name for her myself, she's called the Lady of Situations, and that's the title of this poem. You know, situations in the sense of she's always getting involved, or people are always getting involved. This is that Lady of Situation. And, oh yes, there's some erudition in this one too, there's a marvelous drawing taken from the tomb of Tuthmosis [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1320491], which appears in the Skera, Egyptian Painting Volume, and you might look it up because she appears there as a tree, a breasted tree, and giving suck to a Pharaoh, it's quite interesting as a painting, anyway, that's in here too.

The, I noticed that the Brotherhood of Railroad Engineers has arranged to have separate drinking glasses, or they're trying to get themselves put into the sanitary code, I think this is Roy's. This must be mine, still water. This next one, I wrote the day following my seeing of a movie that I hope many of you are familiar with, it's the Russian version of Don Quixote [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49612156], a lovely film, beautiful adaptation of the myth of Don Quixote, and Sancho Panza [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q630823] in the terms of the revolution to come, and I was particularly fascinated to the title that was given to Don Quixote, in this film, so I used it for the title of the poem.
 
Richard (Dick) Sommer
00:10:54
Reads ""Don Quixote de la Manchesky"".
 
Richard (Dick) Sommer
00:13:25
This next one takes its title, this is another area of that reference, takes its title from a little known and very important folk ballad, I had to put something in ethnic here, so this is it. It's, the title is ""The Other Side of the Mountain"", and it comes from that little song that begins ""The bear climbed over the mountain to see what he could see, but the other side of the mountain was all that he could see"".
 
Richard (Dick) Sommer
00:14:05
Reads ""The Other Side of the Mountain"".
 
Richard (Dick) Sommer
00:17:15
Incidentally, you must not get the idea that the mountain, you know, came entirely from the, from the, from the song. It, you can find it on the Greater Barrington Quadrangle, for the appropriate section of the Massachusetts [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q771] of the US [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] geological survey, it's right on the map. It's really there, it's got position. This poem is in four sections, there are three narrative sections and then there's a short epilogue. And it's called ""My Loveliest Enemies"". I don't think there's any point in keeping you in suspense about this, my loveliest enemies are birds. And that's the punchline, so now you know it and you can listen to the poem.
 
Richard (Dick) Sommer
00:18:24

It's a race against not time but against the creeping gelatination, I think is the word of my lower extremities, and I'm sure the creeping sleepiness that is likely to affect you. This next, excuse me, here's to you! This next poem requires an erudite explanation too and I'm sorry for that. I hope, actually, it's not necessary. Alcuin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q154332], the Charles the King, Alcuin was an 8th century scholar who was brought from his, from the York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42462] diocese, to the court of Charlemagne [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3044], and there became the principal architect of Charlemagne's attempt to bring Latin and Latin culture to the Francs. You might say, I suppose, that he was the first of, first great humanist, but we'll see what his Latin is worth in this poem. This is a letter, written by Alcuin, actually it was written by me, presumably written by Alcuin, to Charles the King.
 
Richard (Dick) Sommer
00:37:33
Reads ""Letter written by Alcuin, to Charles the King"".

Ladies and Gentleman, um, let's see, what am I going to say? [Audience laughter and applause]...Well, glad to see y’all here. So, Professor Louis Dudek []https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3261787] from McGill University [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201492] will introduce the two poets who’re reading this evening. 

Audience
00:00:31
Applause.

Louis Dudek
00:00:40
I expected a longer introduction than that, it will be very fine. There are two kinds of readings that I like to attend very much, one kind is the sort that they're having tonight at McGill University, where a well-established poet who has been on the scene for forty or fifty years comes to read. Over there, it's A.J.M. Smith [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4647944] from Michigan State [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270222], Canadian anthologist and well-known poet. With a poet like that, really makes no difference what he reads or how he reads it's just important to see him and even the tottering saint can perform miracles on occasions. The other kinds of poets I do like to hear very much are the sort that we'll hear tonight, Gnarowski and Beissel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1606507]. The McGill publicity department sent out a notice about A.J.M. Smith and described him as well-known Anthropologist of Canadian poetry. Actually, they corrected it in ink, they made the mistake twice though, probably a typist error. But they didn't know how correct they were, with the current scene in Canadian writing, there are primitive types around that are hard to classify and we need anthropologists...Well, Beissel and Gnarowski are not of this breed of poets who seem to have lost all sense of poetic organization or form, where you think that conventions, poetic conventions have been abolished and what is left are chaotic bits of internal monologue on the page. Of course, that kind of school may be very interesting to watch to see what comes out of it but at present, having watched it now for a few years I'm a little impatient often and tired of the magazines where this material occurs because it seems so easy to turn out and anyone has these bits of chaotic monologue going on. On the other hand, there are many poets still writing who are not following the conventional forms of English metrics and rhyme and so forth, who are turning out poems or at least watching what happens what happens with the words on the page and both the poets we're listening to tonight are of this kind. They are very careful craftsmen. Henry Beissel has the long list of achievements to his credits already, but two on that list strike me very much. One is, amongst many of the posts where he's taught, one is the University of Alberta [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q640694] is the kind of political stir that was created on the campus when his magazine Edge was brought into the classroom by one of the professors. That is, his poetry contains, content that can make one think, that is morally committed to certain issues in today's world. He's very strongly a moral poet on one side, and the other item in his biography is his new book which has just appeared New Wings for Icarus, which is extremely aesthetic at the same time that it is meaningful in this way. His poetry seems to combine two things, one is a moral urgency and on the other hand, at the same time, a romantic sense of language and of imagery and of emotion that goes with that, which are all very, very promising characteristics for a beginning poet, but I think that this New Wings for Icarus book is his first considerable book. So, without more ado, I introduce to you Henry Beissel. 

Henry Beissel
00:05:30
When I considered the kind of poems that I might read this evening and the order in which to read them, I was thinking of the condition of this hall, as it was the last time I was here and I therefore chose two poems which I wrote in the West Indies [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q669037]. [Audience laughter]. They celebrate the sun in an ambiguous sort of way, I'm going to read them all the same, despite the fact that the conditions have changed. I don't know how much you need to know about the West Indies, I'm hoping—oh.

Audience Member 1

Henry Beissel
00:06:39
Well I'll try to speak a little louder on my own, in spite of the microphone. I was saying that I don't know how much one needs to know of the West Indies to respond to this sort of poem, I'm hoping something of the West Indies might be in the poems, the first is called ""Pans at Carnival"". Pan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6610630] is the expression for a steel drum. The imagery in the poem is taken entirely from the steel drum and its use at Carnival [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4618], a feast that is about to be celebrated in Trinidad [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q754] in about a month. Rhythmically, the poem tries to catch something of the rhythm of the steel pan.

Next I want to read two parts from New Wings for Icarus. Time does not allow me to read the whole poem, because then I could read you nothing else. “Icarus” is a poem that is written in four parts, it is with some regret that I read only two, because to me it is like playing the second and fourth part of a symphony, but there is no alternative.

Now for a little sort of relaxation in-between, I find unrelieved serious poetry hard to bear myself, I'll read—unfortunately I do not write occasional poems terribly often, they always seem to grow into something much bigger than I can handle, but the next two poems I want to read you are occasional poems, poetry can come out of anything of course, and this one came out of an encounter in a house of Inquisition in Cartagena [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q657461], in Colombia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739], it is really self-explanatory. It's called ""En la Casa de Inquisición"".

The next poem leads me on to the last set of poems, but you won't discover that until you hear the last two poems. This poem is dedicated to my daughter, when she was 1 and a half, the first stanza deals with the circumstances of her birth, which were somewhat elaborate, there were firemen. The second stanza deals with her present—this would be the past from the time of the poem, the second deals with her present, and the third with her future.

And now I come to the final two poems. They belong together and are part of a— we agreed not to torture you and not to read for more than 30 minutes this evening and I am trying to stick to that. This is rather the beginning of something that I may never live to finish, the entire thing is supposed to have some 26 poems, of which you will hear the first two, one is a prologue and the other one is called ""Adam Enter Eve"". In the prologue, a character introduces himself who is to play his part in the rest of the poem. It's not really a dramatic poem, although it's, well I don't think of it as a drama, although it has dramatic qualities. Anyway, I don't like to be my own critic. I prefer just to read you the poem. The whole cycle will be called ""The Dancer from the Dance"" that is as you no doubt know, a quotation from Yeats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213].

Strongly I was impressed and moved by that reading by Henry Beissel. Really several times after the poems I wanted to applaud, only we don't do that. They were magnificently organized forms with powerful language and very well read, I felt, I think I'm speaking for most people here when I say that. Mike Gnarowski who reads next is different perhaps in the extent to which his poetry is oriented towards reality. Not by implication because Beissel's also is very real and very down to earth and very much committed to the real world, but Gnarowski's poetry has a lot to do with Canadian poetry and the way it has turned towards the real world since about 1925 since A.J.M. Smith and Scott [F.R. Scott; https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3081656] and A.M. Klein [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2778027] began writing. Gnarowski's been very active as a student of Canadian literature, a scholar and a bibliographer and so forth of our literature looking into the sources of this modern poetry and to letters and documents. In this he has done some very valuable work, indexing little magazines that would be otherwise, less well known, preparing bibliographies and he is now working on a larger anthology of criticism introducing the backgrounds of modern Canadian poetry. All this kind of study which is very valuable on the academic side is also important to his poetry I feel, that it places him within the line of modern Canadian poets who have tried to interpret the real, the visible, the actual, directly in poetry. Somewhat in the way I suppose that all modern poetry in English does, including T.S. Eliot's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37767] ""Waste Land"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q581458] and Ezra Pound's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q163366] ""Cantos"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2701465] and e. e. cumming's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298703] comedies and satires and Auden's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178698] poetry also. That is the characteristic of twentieth-century poetry is that its extreme realism and the bringing of the romantic conceptions of the last century to bear upon the actual world and showing that the conflict, the intense conflict that exists in the poet between his conception of things and what he sees before him. That you find in Gnarowski very much. He as a writer he is a meticulous craftsman, I don't know if that's symbolic [audience laughter]... He's also a meticulous craftsman and his poems seem to grow by accretion, very gradually. He writes with a stubborn integrity and knows what he thinks and what he's trying to say in a poem, they aren't just momentary fusions. They're highly worked up pieces of writing. There's a strong element of rationality and reality in this poetry, less of the flight of the emotions and the fantasy that's in most other poets. There's a very strong formal organization in his poetry, a clean speech, straight as the Greeks as Ezra Pound used to say in the past. His first book is entitled Postscript for St. James Street which has to do with, in some part anyhow, with the business world in which we live and he has chosen that quite consciously as a subject that could be turned into poetry, to take the business man, the real in that sense, St. James Street [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1526237] and see what can be made out of that imaginatively. Most poets when they treat a subject like that turn it into satire, because what else can you make out of St. James Street, but Gnarowski wants to keep his vision clear and straight for the fact to see what it really is without elevating too much or perhaps without caricaturing the reality, and it's a very interesting experiment. I'm sure you'll all enjoy listening to his poetry.

A couple of years ago I had the occasion to go up into North Western Ontario [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904], and I lived there for three or four years and more specifically on Port Arthur [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7230482] which is on the very shores of Lake Superior [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1066], and I kept looking at this magnificent and fantastic lake and it kept bothering me. It was too big and too vast and too meaningful and too ominous in many ways to be let off too easily. I also had a friend up there who was an anthropologist and archaeologist and a very good one, and he spent a lot of time going up into that country up around Lake Superior and he kept coming back with all sorts of wonderful thing, all sorts of relics of the past as it were. Gaffs and skulls and this and that which he kept finding and he told me that that part of the world had at one time had supported a pretty fantastic civilization of its own, a very peculiar civilization. And I looked at the lake, Lake Superior, and I decided I would try to write something about it, about the feelings that I think that this ominous body of water might have. A little poem I did for it is entitled ""Great Sea"".

And following along the same themes, a little poem entitled ""Amethyst Harbour"" which was occasioned by a visit of A.Y. Jackson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3499926] and several friends who gathered in this quite magnificent place on the lake, just about this time of the year and you could look out across Thunder Bay [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9298873] and you saw nothing but ice-locked island and of course snow and ice continuing forever and ever. I always felt the nature, of course, there had not been overcome by man and that nature always threatened man and that there was a struggle, a conflict, a tension going on. So here is ""Amethyst Harbour"".

As Louis Dudek pointed out, I've always been fascinated by those men who wheel and deal and who are responsible for much of the life of the nation, I suppose, of North America [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49], the so-called businessman, much maligned most of the time. I normally try to deal as properly as I can and in this instance I think I'm probably being unkind. This is a poem entitled ""Portrait of a Man Come to Say Farewell"".

In view of the embarrassment of having made such a mess of introducing the last poet, I spent a considerable amount of time setting out what I should say this evening, so hopefully I'll be a little more successful. Well, this is our seventh poetry evening and we welcome you all here this cold and blustery evening. Now, this evening we're having Margaret Avison [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6759152] read poems, and I wanted to say a few things about her. I first listened to Margaret read her poems at the poetry conference, University of British Columbia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q391028], during the summer of 1963. Her reading, together with those of the other poets on hand, are among the most memorable occasions I've had in my love affair with poems and poets. Four years later, in early January, we spent an afternoon together. Now I don't want to attribute, what I felt with a thought, on Bloor Street, to our conversation, but the warmth of it was very real. Margaret Avison was born in Guelph [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504114], Ontario [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904]; some early years were spent in Alberta [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1951]; she graduated from Victoria College [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3551503], the University of Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180865], in 1940, with a BA in English Language and Literature. She has been a secretary of all sorts for various firms, individuals, and organizations, and has also been a research assistant and librarian and presently teaches English at Scarborough College, Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172]. 1956-57 she was a Guggenheim Fellow [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P6594] in poetry, and during the forties her work appeared in various Canadian magazines, and in the fifties, mainly in American ones. She has published two books of poems; The Winter Sun in 1960 won the Governor General's Award [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q283256], and in 1966, W.W. Norton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1282208] in New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] issued The Dumbfounding [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42189162], her latest book. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure in introducing to you Margaret Avison.

I don't know about the reading but I do know about the pleasure of meeting Roy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789] again here, and being introduced by him. If this were Monday, or up to a week from tonight, I would be able to join the Angry Art Week. I don't know if anybody else has received these letters, but in New York City initially they're trying this and anybody who gets a letter from them is asked to dedicate any reading or event to what they're trying to do. You can still send them money, too, I'll give you the address if you want it later. What they're going to do is play harps in railroad stations and have...lets see, Bach [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1339] cantatas in railroad stations, play-ins in various museums and the lobbies of concert halls, recital halls, business buildings--I like that one--dramatic presentations in laundromats and supermarkets, [audience laughter], a paint-in, and fences and billboards throughout Manhattan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11299] with their work showing and so on. This is a series. ""What we're trying to do is through art to reach the American people as human beings."" So...[audience laughter]. If this were Monday I'd dedicate the reading [audience laughter and applause]...This is all very orderly, although it doesn't look it, and it starts with other people's poems of various kinds. A little section of C. Bukowski [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76409], somebody said that's Charles, an American poet. It's a great long thing that was in a mimeograph magazine, and the description is of a woman with a bicycle and a baby carriage, high-heeled shoes, white socks, and all her belongings, on a hot day in the middle of a road in a city.

That's sad, so on the same page I copied one of Al Fowler's, which was in a magazine called Lines, which is the all-time happiest little poem, and I don't know why. I'm going to stop where the lines stop, not where the sense stops, so you can see the shape of it.  There's no capital letters. There's no title.

Feels as if I should be doing something different, but I don't know what. I did a poem to people writing examinations I'm hunting for, but I think I've forgotten it. There's three about this odd experience of teaching and students. This one was written before I had had the experience, but was looking forward to it. And it had the title ""Is That You/Me Standing on My/Your Feet?"" And it's very full of fine theory and idealism.

I had planned to get all this organized on the plane, but I was in the middle of the three seats and I kept getting the briefcase out and everything would fall to the floor, and this one would dive for it, or this one, and I finally gave up, so it's upside down. This is dedicated to Jacques Ellul [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q322922], The Technological Society [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1607727], a book he wrote that's a little mad but very stirring.

There's one here that is just the equivalent to sketching, I guess. I know a poet in Chicago [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1297] who used to go and sit around in the Art Institute [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q239303], when it was a fairly quiet room, and stare all morning, and if any words occurred to him, he dashed them down. And sometime he worked up his sketches and sometime he didn't, which is a technique that's lots of fun to practice, and occasionally something grows out of it. In this case I don't think I'll ever do anything but it'll show you the kind of thing that I mean, if, as I assume, most of you are writers.

I think I should read a long, fierce poem. This is not by me except translated. It's the poem of Gyula Illyes [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q381107], called ""Of Tyranny, In One Breath"". Ilona Duczynska [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q967353] did a literal translation for me and then read it to me for sound and we worked through it that way.  Apparently the poem started, or happened, in 1956 in Budapest [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1781]. Illyes had written it some years before but hadn't been angry enough at the time to risk what it was to bring it out. But he grew angry enough and somebody said the one thing that nobody censors is the magazine which tells you what lectures are going on where and what movies are running where and is just a news sheet, and the middle spread was for advertising, so they printed this in the middle sheet and it was, they tried to stop it as soon as the authorities found it but by then they were storming the radio station or however it started. I can't do it in one breath because it goes on for several pages. In the first part of it, ""it,"" meaning ""tyranny"" is small ""i"" and towards the end it's a capital ""I.""

So, after the revolution he was much too well-known to disappear but they said he was insane and he was in an asylum for a while, but he wrote a lot of lovely things there, so I don't think he was, and he's not there now.

I've been asked to read ""The Valiant Vacationist"". It was written so many years ago...I think I would be quite right in saying thirty years ago, and probably a little more. And I couldn't write this well now but in a way when you're very young you've got the whole world in one lump without any lump, and you only get bits later on.

Mr. Creeley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q918620] has published too many books for me to list for you this evening, but some titles are deserving of notice. His Collected Poems was published by Scriveners in 1962 under the title For Love. He has also published short stories and they're brought out by Scriveners after first being published, privately I believe, under the title of The Gold Diggers. His most recent book, also brought out by Scriveners, is called Words. Mr. Creeley has a style that is unique and inimitable. There are many, both in this country [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16?wprov=srpw1_0] and in United States of America [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30?wprov=srpw1_0] that are trying to capture the delicate, tenuous quality of his work, and not quite successfully. For his is an art of pauses, of hesitations. He affirms by diffidence, and he destroys our pretensions with a whisper. He uses silence as a modern composer of music [unintelligible], or the way a contemporary painter uses space. He bounces words off against the wall of [unintelligible]. If you listen carefully, you'll hear reverberations and the subtlest of echoes. Mr. Creeley is one of the most honest poets writing today. And a very brave man, who knows the price that has to be paid for a good poem certified to endure. He has written a little song, sing days of happiness, make a pardonable wonder of one's blunders. The man who wrote those words knows all that needs to be known about the perilous vocation of the poet. One critic has said his poems are miniatures, but then hastened to add that they are not miniatures, sorry-One critic has said-this is not from memory-One critic has said that his poems are miniatures, but there's nothing miniature about the power that they release. I have said somewhere that he has written skinny poems, that miraculously grow in length and breath, one's air absorbed into one's consciousness. Slender firecrackers that explode with the power of a bomb. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Creeley.

See now, it's extremely generous, Irving [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1673289], all that. No, because we have had a very long association. I think I'd like to say my piece too, apropos that fact that I think that the kind of community that say either Irving or myself in this way were involved with was what kinds of, no really, how could you find the world?  I mean, I, for example first read his poems in the collection called Cerberus with Louis Dudek [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3261787] and Raymond Souster [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q304129] and then I was very interested in the magazine that they had going called Contact, I was looking for connections I suppose, the man, in no hips sense, but we were, I was extraordinar--I wanted to know where the world was, and Irving seemed to be very much, very much part of any world I certainly could respect. And so, what he generously and definitely himself ignores was that he was that he was a very decisive contributing editor for the Black Mountain Review, and it was really, a very decisive friend all those fifteen years he imagines. Let me read now. Let me start from back then, ""A Song"".

I was thinking Paul Blackburn [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7149388] happily has been here, so this is a poem, again of the same, the same situation that we were very active in the exchange of, I mean, again I want to emphasize  the sense that we were looking around to see what kinds of possibility that we could find in the world and I suppose if we shared anything, I was thinking of Irving's lovely stories and letters about the problems of visiting literary parties [laughs] and partly being forbidden because he made such awkward problems for guests and hosts, etc. So that Paul Blackburn at this point was translating from Provencal poetry, he'd been at the University of Wisconsin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q838330] and had had a very active and useful relation with the woman there, I think it was, teaching Provencal, so that he'd also been very involved with Pound [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q163366?wprov=srpw1_0], with Pound's senses of activity in verse and had therefore become particularly interested in Provencal and had begun to translate, and through the same agency that we had in Mallorca [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8828], my wife and I then, the so called Divers Press that had published Irving's book, we published a collection of Paul's Provencal translations called Proensa. So the title, is actually Paul's title, I can't now remember what- I don't think he ever published the poem it was the title for, but I was struck by it, and you know, you take things, obviously from friends, it was that you were stealing, but that it was always a common situation. It's a form of adaptation, and I think a young friend now at Buffalo [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q681025] were presently working was telling me that I am in the courtly tradition which is confusing to me, but I can see what he means simply that did pick up a lot through Paul Blackburn and writers in this way using a vocabulary or sense of possibility involved with that kind of writing. So this poem, for example, would be, would be actually a, would be a poem not written by Paul Blackburn, but a poem much informed by his way of perceiving. ""A Form of Adaptation"".

I want to go back to this one. There's one... called, ""Anger"". This interpolates, so to speak of. I've been traveling in an extraordinary company of people the last, or the week previous and then, we'll see them again at the same activity tomorrow night in New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60?wprov=srpw1_0]. We were billed as quote contemporary voices in the arts, unquote, but apart from that the, we were visiting various colleges and universities in the Upstate New York area from say Albany State [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4709390] to Rensselaer Polytechnic [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49211] to Potsdam [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7603628], and then places St Lawrence [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1411093] or Union College [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1567748] and we were trying, in effect, to- we had the problem of we were billed as a panel, seven men, sitting down to discuss- John Cage [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180727] is one of the participants, and he said, 'well', of course if we sit down, we say, 'well where do you think art is going?' and then you have to figure out where do you think art's come from? [laughter] And at that point you just might as well come home because it's going to be a long, long conversation. So we decided that we would, instead of having the formal sense of panel, that we would simply create, improvise, or go about in effect at our own activity, except that we wouldn't isolate ourselves in that but would simply try to improvise, as we were seven people, a poem that could permit each one of us to be active, all together so that we at no point had much- we had no decision as to what the others would be doing, so that the whole activity occurred as the complex, and I was- I mean, I had never had any experience of this kind previously at all, John Cage had made, oh very large decisions indeed about this kind of possibility in music, simply that he wanted all possibility of sound to be admitted into the context that music proposes. He also had very decisive relation to what are called loosely 'happenings', and both he and Merce Cunningham [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q318364], another participant, had in that with some previous experience, but the point is that they weren't- neither was trying to create a system from previous experience, but again was trying to think of how this activity of seven people could be evident in ways that simply didn't create a three-ring circus but was actually a participation so, I was intrigued, I was extraordinarily intrigued as to how words, as poetry and whatnot could enter into this circumstance, and because I literally was in it, I have in a sense no quote objective unquote experience at all, but it was extraordinary to me to hear how things are heard in a multiple, in a multiple event, rather than the kind of singularity that this occasion proposes. So I still have that on my mind in a way, and I may, I really do feel that say, all the arts, I mean if one does want some kind of statement about them, that all the arts are moving into a situation where the agency is becoming less and less singular, I don't mean necessarily that in some seminal sense, that everyone's quote an artist, I mean I don't know what an artist is, in one way at all, but I think that the participation is becoming much more a situation of process and activity, and that it is becoming less and less evident as one singular isolation of person, and I realize in my own writing how much the previous condition had been my, my occasion. So, I may be reading these poems for the last time in that sense. I'm certainly prepared to do so, I'm not at all interested in continuing an activity that maybe, you know, maybe have much more experience or much more range of possibility than say contemporary habits about it seem to imply. But anyhow, that was interesting to me to have that experience and also interesting of course is what it had as an impact on educational process. Immediately this activity finished and I've never been in such a- I mean I've been, you know, like they say in [unintelligible] auditorium in the summer, I certainly have seen light shows and other [unintelligible] happenings, a few years ago, it was Roy Kiyooka [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789], knows, having been there also, there was an extraordinary happening like they say put on by the Tate Music Center from San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62]  [unintelligible] being the painter doing the so called decor, doing the set, the set that was used, creating the visual. But this other thing was something quite distinct, simply that each person was so active in ways that he couldn't anticipate and we had with us also Billy Kluver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4912866], who can be most easily identified as the man who, is literally is an Engineer at Bell Labs [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217365] in New Jersey [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1408?wprov=srpw1_0] who engineered the 9 Evenings [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4646407] of the Armory [Hall (?)] in company with Rauschenberg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q164358], [Vergan (?)] and Cage [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180727] and others, a situation that brought technology into close apropos with the arts, and led to the practical effects of this activity are very evident, it led to ten patented inventions, all of which have much more extensive use, let's say than that occasion of those particular evenings. That was [unintelligible] you know, many, many poets [unintelligible] of this kind, that is, it turns out that when the arts are permitted this situation, that, I think we were talking to Irving earlier this evening, I think we both fear a situation, or have some kind of, feeling of personal awkwardness about a situation that is turning to the arts as if the arts had a necessary message or condition of life to stake for people to have use of, I mean, again, in these evenings we were round in these colleges, I mean the students or the people present, again and again said that ""what were you trying to tell us?"" And the point was that we weren't trying to tell them anything. We were in fact, we thought, that the activity was something which each person could have experienced, it would be like going to the beach and saying what do you think the water is trying to tell us? [audience laughter.] And you stand there, you're swimming [unintelligible] for two hours enjoying yourself thoroughly and then you come out and say to your friend, but what did it all mean? You know, we assumed that the people there would have some - would have some decision of their own, you know, did you think it was too cold, or too hot, or did you enjoy it, or you know, that's the kind of question no one can answer for you. In any case, I do feel the arts has, as Irving feels also, are being turned to, as some possibility of decision in contemporary society and don't think they can offer that ever, I don't- I think the very value of the arts is that they have no conclusion of this kind to propose, that what they do give is something I think perhaps Pound puts as ably as anyone when he says that ""art is the antenna of the race"". It's a very large statement obviously, and I think what he proposes in it is perhaps even can be put more simply in that the arts tend to experience the condition of the society that is, in a sense, and that way I have use of the condition of the society, perhaps more immediately than any other definition or activity in the society, I mean they tend to respond to the present condition perhaps more decisively than any other segment, I mean everyone else tends, not- I don't mean this in any put down sense of their attitudes in this society but I mean, that as the war goes on because it's an historical precedent and so on and so forth, I mean people continued to act as though what they were doing is still what they are doing, what they are doing is still what they were doing and they literally tend to continue in those habits of attitude or activity until something simply makes them impossible, but the arts tend to have experience I think of present condition, that they have no other viable occasion, they tend to propose what the immediate experience of say any life situation simply is, but they have no instruction therefore offer except that is possible, so that as I say, if poetry, as we've now experienced it is about to yield to another situation that is if books or printed medium of this order are to be changed, in societal experience, great, I mean I don't see why I want you to have to carry around all these pieces of paper, there must be, I'm sure that there's a simple way to communicate this kind of content but I do want to make the insistence that these poems or what I'm doing here has- I mean, I'm enjoying this, I'd probably do this even if you weren't here. [audience laughter], obviously did do it, you know. Now this is something else again, I had no messages, if the media is the message, this is perhaps the most absolute demonstration you'll probably get. ""Anger"".

Read a story that's in effect going back some time to the time of the writing of the Island, a novel. And I hadn't written any prose for some time, not since the middle 50's and I had a [joke (?)], myself and my wife and our four kids were all down in Guatemala [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q774]where I was tutoring children on a coffee plantation, and having that kind of isolation and time that seemed to, you know, have the possibility to try some prose. I like prose simply that it has--it's continuous, it permits a kind of variety of activity in ways that sometimes poetry from my own experience, at least in the way I'm given to write it, doesn't altogether- I mean, the emotional demand, let's say in a poem is in my own experience has known it, is of such order that alternatives in a curious way aren't possible, you simply say what you're thus brought to say as best you can. In prose, the emotional so called situation tends to be more various, it goes up, down, it ebbs, flows, re-forms, changes its mind, and so on and so forth, so I--not in recent years, I think the last prose I wrote was this novel, called the Island and I've not really written any since, that's about--when I was in Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639]teaching I finished that novel, and that was the last prose I think I've written and hopefully won't--I would like to go back to prose for a time. I'd like to have it open, I mean, again, this experience of being with these particular people, whenever habits become, oh let's say whenever you expect everything to be as you have experienced, it's time to look out or do something else because it means that you're assuming of the reality of your life has become too much of a pattern of a habit. Anyhow, this is a story called ""The Book"". I sort of like this story.

He is a very active promoter of new Canadian poetry and he himself has published in several little magazines in Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] and he has made translations from Erik Satie's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q187192] notes to the music, he has also been published in New Wave Canada, an anthology of new Canadian poets published by Contact Press, and edited by Raymond Souster [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q304129]. He is also affiliated, his press, Island Press, is affiliated with the Coach House Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5137585] in Toronto and through this press a book of his poems will be appearing this spring. He is our first reader and our second reader is Mr. George Bowering [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280], who has already published three books, the first one by Contact Press called Points On The Grid, the second one, The Silver Wire published by Quarry Press and the third one, A Man in Yellow Boots, by El Corno Emplumado which was done bilingually in Spanish and in English and which contains montages and illustrations by poet and artist Roy Kiyooka [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789]. Mr. Bowering is also editor of Imago Magazine, which emanated from Alberta [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1951] and which is devoted to the long poem or the longer poem, he is expecting to publish very shortly, in the spring I believe, a novel called The Mirror on the Floor. Mr. Coleman will read first, and then there will be a short intermission, and then Mr. Bowering will read to you.

I like to make it a habit always at a reading to start off with something that somebody else wrote, simply to show you that my concerns lie elsewhere, then in my own self. This is something from A History of America by an American writer by the name of Bill Hutton and it's— well, I won't explain it to you.

I'm going to focus on that clock every once in a while, simply because I want to keep track of myself. If I might say, um, it's interesting that I'm reading with George Bowering and my general tenure at this time, uh, which I'm not really that self-conscious about which is interesting to me to be growing a beard at this time and that the last time that I started to grow a beard was the first time that I met George Bowering and it was about two years ago and we were sitting up in my attic which was a room and I said to him, ""How do you like my beard?"" and he says that ""It makes you look like an impotent D.H. Lawrence [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34970]”. [Audience laughter]. This is a poem called ""The Lady Vanishes"".

Here's a kind of poem that I can bug everybody with because it probably won't mean anything to you at all, but simply because it really is my occasion but rather than hide it away, um, I think that the sound of it is enough to carry to you, some measure of the poetry that I got from the occasion that I speak of. It's called ""For Basil Bunting"".

I don't know whether any of you are familiar with a Japanese-English dictionary called Kenkyusha [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6389422], if not, all I can tell you is that it's a Japanese-English dictionary and that it has a strange quality to be able to predict the future, by chance operations in that it's very fat and you open it and you're like the guy with the funny hat at the track who really shouldn't be there because he can only guess and he just opens the racing form and sticks his finger on the horse and he bets on the horse and he usually loses. Kenkyusha is a little better than that because you're not trying to win anything, you're looking for some kind of instruction and the time I wrote these poems I was rather desperate for some kind of instruction, and uh, it's just a matter of opening the book, pointing and getting the epigraph for each poem from the Japanese-English dictionary. I'll just read a couple. ""Day Seven"", oh there are given days, that are sort of daily devotions.

...Irving Layton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1673289] to this stage again tonight, this time to read his poetry. The last time he was up here was to introduce Robert Creeley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q918620], and what was said then clearly explained the close relations between Mr. Layton and the Black Mountain Group [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2905420] in the 50's, so I won't go into that again, but I'll only add that Mr. Layton was a member of the editorial board of Black Mountain Review [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2905420] from 1955 on. Of course he's been publishing poetry since the 40's and was associated during those years with the First Statement Press, which became the Northern Review [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15757902] in 1949, and all this time studying at McGill University [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201492] where he received the M.A. in Political Science and Economics in 1946. It's impossible to list all of his appearances in periodicals and little magazines, and I'll mention only a few of his two dozen or so volumes of poetry, anyway that's what it seemed like to me when I looked at that page in the new one. A Red Carpet for the Sun in 1959, with the well-known introduction by William Carlos Williams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106] which acknowledged, American recognition of Mr. Layton's reputation. A Red Carpet, like all of Mr. Layton's subsequent books was published by McClelland and Stewart [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6800322]. Then, a book of short stories and poems, The Swinging Flesh, which came out in 1961, Balls for a One-armed Juggler in 1963, The Laughing Rooster in 1964, Collected Poems in 1965 and his latest work, just published this winter, Periods of the Moon. And I should say the ones that I have mentioned are the ones which are still in stock and able to be bought. Among Mr. Layton's other frenetic activities, poetry readings in Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16], United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30], Germany [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183] and elsewhere, television appearances, controversial ones and so on, he finds time to communicate with students as well as Poet in Residence of this university [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342]. I'd like to present Mr. Irving Layton.

Thank you Howard, for your kind introduction. I'm glad that you did not introduce me as a letter writer. I'm very glad to see so large a turn out this evening. I am very heartened by it, very moved, and I'm very glad to see so many of my friends and former students in the audience. I like beginning my reading with a poem ""There Are No Signs"" because if any one poem expresses what I try to say, and all the poems and stories that I have written, is that modern man, pretty well, has to find out where he is going, by just going. Now the old sign posts are down, and that he must make his sign posts as he goes along.

Several years ago I taught at the Jewish Library, one of my students was a Mrs. Fornheim, who had lived in Vienna [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1741], and left Vienna when that city fell to the Nazis. She went to Paris [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90], and left Paris for Spain [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29], when the Vichy government was formed. From Spain, she went to Portugal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q45] and then came to Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340], where I taught her English. She died of cancer, this is my poem for her. ""Mrs. Fornheim, Refugee"".

And where you are entranced by the church bells every Sunday, because of the ecstatic music over the sky, over the rooftops, and yet, in that ecstatic music of the bells, a sound of menace, something alien and frightening.

This is how the fringes of a prayer shawl, a sheitel is a wig. If you are an Orthodox, Jewess as my mother was, you have to cut your hair very short and wear a wig so that you are no longer attractive so to speak, to any other man but your husband. Peculiar way of looking at it.

""Vexata Quaestio"". Western man is the product we are told, of two traditions, the Greek, and the Hebrew. The Greek, pagan, believing that all experience is worth having, and man should refuse no experience. The Hebrew believing that the proper life, salvation is to be found in obedience to God's will. The two traditions are quite contradictory and can never be reconciled. It is our unfortunate destiny to try to reconcile them. I do not think we have been successful at it because the task cannot be done, it's impossible. So I've written this poem, ""Vexata Quaestio"" and what I'm saying is that each and every one of us in the West is a sort of compromise between these two traditions. Here I use the tree, a tall tree, as a symbol for the Hebraic, the Maccabean and the sun becomes a symbol for the pagan, and you'll see what happens to both the tree and the sun.

Only humans of course are aware of death, and even in August, when you feel the flush and thrill and intensity of life, you are aware of the autumn and the winter and when you are in a cemetery, the macabre juxtaposition of life and death becomes even more intense. So I wrote this poem, ""Cemetery in August"".

And I was very fortunate one year in having six very, very lovely, nubile adolescents, very attractive, and very, very well aware of precisely where attractions lay [audience laughter]. And very often when I was in the middle of a serious lecture in history, one of them would make some provocative gesture that would drive my thoughts from the lecture to something far more interesting [audience laughter].

Like Yeats, I believe that great art results from the happy, the miraculous fusion of the two.

It is truism to say that unless man's moral development, his capacity for sympathy, keeps space, or this development in science and technology he's in danger of blowing himself off the face of this earth. This poem is an apocalyptic poem, it is a vision of the future, such as I hope will never be realized. But in one of my more despairing moments, or one of my more savage and bitter moments, I wrote this poem, ""The Improved Binoculars"".

""Song for Naomi"". Naomi's my daughter. Several years ago we were out in the country, I was appalled to find that while she was by the bank of the lake, I couldn't see her because the weeds and the flowers were taller than she was. If she fell into the lake, neither I nor my wife might see it. But nothing happened. Just a day before we were to pack up to leave, I noticed my daughter down by the lake, and this time, her dear little head was peeping just above the weeds and the flowers and this gave me the idea for this poem, which I wrote, while of course my wife did the packing.

This next poem is for my mother, who died at the age of 89. She was a very remarkable woman, I'd like to tell you a great deal about her, she certainly merits it, she was a most remarkable character with a tremendous joie-de-vivre and a wonderful gift of vituperation, which it is said I have inherited [audience laughter]. Certainly I learned the cadence of poetry from my mother's cursing. My mother would start cursing as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning and wouldn't stop cursing until I closed them at night when I went to bed. But the cadence was what interested me [audience laughter] and I didn't pay any attention to words. Occasionally I would get the drift, of course, of what the curses were intended to say, and I must say it did me a wonderful lot of good because later on when I got knocked my critics and so on, it was like so much water off a duck's back after my mother's cursing. Nothing the critics say could possibly make any impression upon me whatsoever [audience laughter]. She was extremely vain of her black eyebrows. When she was 85, I was taking her somewhere and we stopped for a red light. I noticed a very lovely girl standing on the curb, and of course, I looked very intently at her. My mother caught my intent gaze and said, sighing, ""Yes, she's very beautiful, but has she got my black eyebrows?"" [audience laughter]. She wore earrings that were made of old Romanian coins, she wore an amber necklace, which I remember playing with when I was a child. But it was her immense vitality and joie-de-vivre, coupled with an immense discontent that always fascinated me about my mother. She was a very Orthodox woman, reverencing God, but often giving me the impression that she might have made a much better job of creation than God himself. So this is my tribute to my very, very remarkable mother.

Some time ago, I went down to the church at Notre Dame, and you know, you have halos lighting up over the head of your favourite saint, or the Virgin Mary, if you drop the requisite number of coins. There's nobody else in that vast gloomy church, except another man and myself, and he went over to the little machine and he dropped some coins, and he waited for the halo to light up and it didn't. And that nettled him a great deal, and he waited, and it still didn't light up so he gave the machine a kick, nothing happened. But he said something and I went home and I wrote this poem.

This next poem of mine is also based on an actual experience, I'm sure that most of you have heard of Djilas [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q153909], the very courageous Yugoslav writer who's imprisoned by his erstwhile comrade and companion in arms, Tito. He's imprisoned for writing and publishing outside of the country, Conversations with Stalin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5166446]. That was several years ago, he's just been released. Well I thought a brave man like that deserves some kind of support, especially from and by writers, and so I decided to go up to Ottawa [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1930] and demonstrate in front of the Yugoslav Embassy. I took my wife with me, and one or two of the local poets, we made some signs and we drove up to Ottawa. We got out of the car, and the sign read, of course, ""Free Djilas"", and I was amazed and delighted to find that a considerable crowd gathered around me and the sign. Until I realized just what was happening. And so I wrote this poem, called ""Free Djilas"".

First of all I have a very, very bad poem that I can't resist reading. I realized that it's sort of a bad beginning to start off with a poem that the poet himself considers a very bad one, but I wrote this when I arrived here this afternoon. To the natural egotism of a poet, you see, I can't resist offering it to this sort of captive audience here. [Audience laughter]. ""Poem for the Ritz Carlton"". [Audience laughter].

This poem is entitled ""The Cinnamon Bears"", which sounds at first as if it were some sort of an animal cooking. But actually, what these cinnamon bears were, was back around the turn of the century in New Brunswick [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1965], as I've been told, there were all sorts of touring side-show type of things, you know, that, fortune tellers, and...people with a monkey, organ grinders with a monkey, and all this type of, sort of strolling pyres or wandering minstrels that existed up until the advent of radio and television. And it was a terrific thing, of course, in these backwoods communities. No doubt throughout Canada and the United States, when one of these people arrived. And among the, among these people were men who had trained bears, who, because of their colouration, were called cinnamon bears. And this poem actually is sort of a found poem, because it's not so much a creative thing as it is the transcription of a conversation which I happened to overhear between an old couple in northern New Brunswick. A man and his wife in their seventies, when they, suddenly something brought back these memories of these days of the organ grinders and the cinnamon bears. And as I say, I sort of made the poem more or less by simply transcribing the things which they said to one another, which it seemed to me was sort of a poetry, a form of poetry itself.

This is another, sort of a found poem, I'm not really terribly convinced that it's a poem at all. Last year, when I had a quite serious illness, one afternoon I was in the waiting room at the doctor's office, and the only thing that seemed to lay at hand for me to read was a copy of one of these Confessions magazines entitled Secret Life. [Audience laughter]. And as I glanced through it, it seemed to me, all that I actually read of it, you know, were these sort of captions at the top of the articles, and some of the big type in it. But it seemed to me really, as I glanced through it, that it had, that it contained sort of a crazy poetry of its own. At least, in the mood that I was in at the time, I sort of responded to it as though it were a crazy sort of poetry. And so as I sat there I sort of jotted down some of these things from the magazine, and ever since I've been trying to pass it off as a poem.

Here's a fairly recent poem which isn't a political poem at all, but a human poem. And one that I wrote as a result of watching on television the debates in the United Nations [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1065] on the Middle East [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7204] crisis. And one of the horrible things I felt as I watched it was how completely dehumanized it all was, that the real, human issues had been lost sight of, and sort of drowned in an ocean of resolutions and memos from embassies and all this sort of things. And one night when they televised these sessions through until about four o'clock, the ambassador of Saudi Arabia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q851] spoke, and he delivered certainly a very bigoted speech, and one that as a speech I wouldn't have agreed with, but I felt an admiration for him, because it had seemed to me that he was the only really human thing that had happened there all day. You know, that certainly he was a bigoted old man, full of thousands of years of hatred, but it was a human hatred, expressed in a human manner, something that the rest of them had completely lost sight of. And as a result of this feeling I wrote this poem, ""For Jamil Baroody [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96384169], Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United Nations on the Occasion of his Address to the Security Council, June 1967"".

Finally, this is a poem entitled ""State Visit"", and the motivation of it, like one of the earlier ones I read, was sort of this same feeling of frustration at the complete dehumanization of politics as we feel it today, and particularly, this sort of apotheosis of world leaders into some sort of a symbol, so they even, I think, begin to think of themselves in these sort of abstract terms, rather than as a human being. And out of--this is sort of, I suppose, perhaps to a degree sort of a bitter little poem, but it stemmed from an emotion which I'm sure many of us feel.

Thank you very much, Mr. Hoffman, I'm delighted to be here. If you can't hear me, raise your hands or let me know by some other device. Is this a microphone or does this have to do with this machine? Well I'll try to be clear. I thought rather than read a kind of segmented, like a string of sausages, series of poems, going on and on and on, which gives one very little hope that it'll ever end, it'd be better to say that I'm going to have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that would be...and so I've arranged the poems in this way, so you will have hope that I won't continue forever, which has been done, in the annals of poetry. I wanted to write, read some poems that have to do with place, because I've thought a lot about the effect of place on poems, and to what extent the place you're in influences what you write. One's imagination would never become extended in certain directions if you hadn't happened to live in a certain place. I was very conscious of that when we lived in Florence [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2044] for two years and when my older boy was born, and subsequently for another two years. And I would never--because we--I would never possibly have been able to think, I mean this is obvious in a way, but it gets more complicated, of...Some of the imaginative happenings that occurred would, could never have happened, well in Massachusetts [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q771] or anywhere else, and also even in, I mean in Vermont [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16551], where we now live, have been profoundly affected by the section of the mountain which we life. And also we spent some time in Haiti [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q790], and so on and so forth, so this first group will be mostly poems that have a lot to do with experiences that have happened because of a particular place. The first poem is an Italian poem, or written out of Italy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38], called ""Primavera"".

Then for a summer, we lived in a little town in the south of France [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q142], Le Lavandou [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q736462], and it was a very good summer all in all, although, except we had no car and a very big house with only about one room on a floor. So the baby was on the top floor, and the kitchen, it's one burner, was on, you know, it's four floors down. And I would rush up and pick him up and then put him back in his bed, and then rush down and light the burner, and then rush up and get him, and then rush down. So it was difficult in some ways. But one of our entertainments, or entertainments that seemed to certainly entertain friends was to go to an island off Toulon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44160] called Ile Levant [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q292516], which is half a naval base and half a colony. And you could go out there in a small--it took about an hour in a small boat, and one time we stood on the dock not quite sure what to do next. Another person who'd come in the boat with us in very high heels and an enormous black hat removed everything else and ran up the hill. [Audience laughter]. So this is “L'Ile du Levant, the Nudist Colony”.

And I stood one evening in very bright moonlight looking out at the shadow of the apple tree across the road on the snow and it made an impression on me, I began to take notes in the dark as best I could on it. And then later, shortly after that, for the death of Kennedy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696], then I saw the poem wasn't, it was inadequate, and I somehow put, wove those two things together.

And most of the time I find I write fish poems when I go down to the islands but this one is about a dead toucan in Guadeloupe. There was a little, well, a strange little zoo at the small hotel where we stayed and we would look at these creatures and one day I went and there was the toucan and it had fallen over dead. Somehow, it made an impression on me. ""Dead Toucan: Guadeloupe"".

I hope you can hear--can you hear me? In the back rows? We also spent some time in Haiti, earlier, and I'd like to read a couple of poems from that period. This was a thing--it could perfectly well have happened elsewhere but it was the kind of thing that, after we lived in Haiti for a while, I could see very clearly, would definitely have to happen there. There was a young man of about nineteen, very talented as a painter, and did, had just tried out through the art centre there, and doing really quite good and interesting work. And he needed a job so he could buy paints and paper, and anyway just to exist. So an American woman had two small boys and he said he could look after them and play ball and, you know, keep them out of trouble and so on and so forth. And she said, “Can you swim?” And he said, “Oh yes, of course.” So the boys dove into the pool because they had been swimming, as most American boys do, for years. And he dove into the pool, and didn't come up. And nobody was around except some workers who were fixing the garden. But like everybody, almost, in Haiti, they didn't want to get involved, because then the police might ask them questions, and then at the end there's trouble, so the poor young man just died, because the little boys couldn't do anything, and nobody else did anything. And so that made an impression on me. But it's the kind of unfortunate tragedy, due to his saying that he could swim and he couldn't, just because he was so desperately anxious to get the job, and he just made himself believe he could swim. Just a complete waste.

I've thought I would read just a few poems by modern poets that I like, they're not by any means their strongest or anything, but they're just ones I'm attached to. The first I cut out of the paper once, a long time ago. It's by an African schoolgirl, and I think it's very imaginative. It's awkward but it's really quite wonderful.

This is an early poem of Wystan Auden's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178698] that he kept out of, he didn't use in his book and then he printed again in a recent edition. I think it's technically as awfully, it's light verse but it's also very serious underneath, as good light verse can me. Poem.

It gets...it's about the Piazza di Spagna [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15124814], the Spanish Steps in Rome [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q220], and it gets the feeling of someone gliding, really gliding down that long, gorgeous stairway.

And then, the last, oh, oh that's right, I thought I would read a poem by Derek Walcott [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132701], which I used in this Carribean Anthology. It's mostly short stories but I put a poem in front of each language section. This is by Derek Walcott who's a young poet from St. Lucia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q760], called ""Missing the Sea"".

[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] And the last of this group is a poem that I've heard about a hundred thousand times, but it still gives me a chill.

The problem is the third group of poems, I'd read some poems that are more or less to and about people, and some new poems, although I've noticed that most of my new poems are very depressing, and this is not a good note on which to end, so I'll maybe not read them. I've been very much interested in old French forms, the trielle, the villanelle, the rondeau and rondelle, and ballade and so on and so forth, and they're very difficult but they're fascinating to try, at least. And this is in the form of a trielle. And the lines have to be repeated in a certain fashion which gives you very little room in which to maneuver. This is called ""Early Supper"".

I wrote three poems at that point about winds, and I'll just read one of them. The winds have names in Italy and they almost become like familiar characters. The sirocco, when it blows, is so terrible in its effect on people that if there're crimes of passion, the people generally get off with a lighter sentence, because you sell, well, the sirocco. Naturally you can throttle your wife during that period. This is about the mistral, which, if it blows for three days, one survives, if it blows for six days it's simply awful. If it blows for nine days you've probably already gone out of your head. It's a very wild wind who rushes down the Rhone Valley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2747791] and just blows everything away.

This is another one, an old French form, the rondeau, which again makes its, has its own complications because of the repetition of lines. And what interested me to do was to try to use, not the usual subject of the rondeaux but to write about, as in this case, the death of a Vermont farm woman, instead of just doing some sort of chittery-chattery business that generally is what people use a rondeau for.

This is a poem about a very disagreeable character, a thirteenth-century tyrant called Ugolino [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q706003], who met his death from being thrown into prison to die of hunger. He is reputed to have attempted to eat his sons, who were there with him. I must say, it's not an agreeable picture, but I don't think there's been much improvement in that part of mankind. Dante [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1067] writes of him in the 33rd Canto of the Inferno [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4509219].

I'd like to welcome you all to our third reading, and announce just before I have to say what I say that the next reading will be with Daryl Hine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5226186] on the first of December. Tonight's reading will be by, as you probably all know, Mr. Charles Reznikoff [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1065911], whom I'm very happy to have the job, the chore of introducing, because I've been interested in his work for many years. He was born in Brooklyn [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18419], 1894, and graduated from the law school of New York University [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49210], admitted to the bar of the state of New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] but never practiced, however, the law experience has stood him in good stead for his later poetry. He's published a number of volumes of verse and several volumes of prose, but most to the point, books that you probably saw on the table outside, in print by New Directions [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27474] and the San Francisco Review [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17087510], By the Waters of Manhattan, which was this joint effort's first book in 1962, and in 1965, Testimony, which is the first volume in a projected series of volumes about the moral and legal history of the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30]. The main--my--the reason I said that I'm very happy about Mr. Reznikoff is because when I was going to university I was very hard looking for an alternative to the kind of poetry that was in vogue, especially in the universities, that is, that which tended towards T.S. Eliot [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37767] and highly symbolic language, and Mr. Reznikoff was one of the first poets I found able to do that for me, and I found a short poem of his which I would like to be brash enough to read, as introduction. He said, ""Not because of victories I sing, having none, but for the common sunshine, the breeze, the largesse of spring. Not for victory, but for the day's work done, as well as I was able, not for a seat upon the dais, but at the common table.""  So to this common table, rather than dais, I'd like to welcome Mr. Charles Reznikoff.

Very much obliged to the gentleman who introduced me, among other things, for reading something I did. Perhaps I should ask him to read all that I brought along. But to get down to what I have here, let me say, to begin with, a few days ago, I came across in a bookshop a collection of Chinese verse translated into English. At the beginning was the following, written a thousand years ago, and I was very much impressed with it, and permit me to read it to you as a sort of an introduction. This man who wrote in the 11th century, this Chinese, said this: ""Poetry presents the thing in order to convey the feeling.  It should be precise about the thing and reticent about the feeling."" I thought that was...expressed exactly what I feel, and what I have tried to do, not always, not always, I'm afraid, as well as called for, but a recipe. Among other things, let me begin by reading a couple of things I did also on the way I think verse should be written. And this is from this, By the Waters of Manhattan.

But I'll end it right here anyway and then we'll see how much time is left. I call this ""Kaddish"". Now, it's not the Kaddish for mourners that you might know about. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352]. I did it; I mean, I did the writing, not the Kaddish, which is very old. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler and his influence, and before his extermination program was put into effect. It's really an ancient blessing in the Jewish ritual. And incidentally, I use that word ""Torah,"" and I doubt, it may be strange to many, but James Parks, I notice, in his History of the Jewish People, has defined it, correctly, I think, ""The word Torah,"" he says, ""has been defined as law, but is much wider in meaning. It applies a way of life"".  Now this is this ""Kaddish"".

Let me close, unless it...if I should...with something that I tried to do which may be something to close with. This is based on the Book of Ezra [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131635], and the Book of Ezra, according to my note, I've probably forgotten by this time, is, 'This is a rearrangement and a versification of parts of the Fourth Book of Ezra.' And that's what it's called in the appendix to the Vulgate [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131175], or two Esdras of the Protestant Apocrypha. And I based this upon a translation of this Book of Ezra from the Syriac by a friend of mine who taught, and I have their permission and all, but the original was probably, there's quite a discussion as to what the original was right, and some scholars believe that it was in Greek, and a Doctor Bocks, who was in, G.H. Bocks, thinks that it was in Hebrew, and Bloch, who was, they had in 42nd Street at the library, didn't think that it was in either Greek or Hebrew, but Aramaic. Anyway, excuse me just, [laughter], anyway, I will read it, and its adaptation of it, and see what one can do with things that you...clear up.

I first met Daryl Hine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5226186] about six years ago in New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60], where he was living in the midst of a colony of cockroaches, and on that occasion, he drank me under the table with more ease and urbanity than anybody that's been able to manage since, which is actually a literary comment on the way he writes poetry. It's a pleasure to welcome him back to Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340], while attending the 'other' university here; before that he lived in Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639], where he was born in 1936, and where he began writing poetry at the age of twelve, and publishing it in such magazines as Northern Review [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15757902] and Contemporary Verse at the age of fifteen. His first book, Five Poems, was published when he was eighteen, and his next, The Carnal and the Crane, established him as an important poet at age 21, when most poets are still cutting their poetic teeth. Since then, his career, like his poetry, has been international, rather than national. After becoming a college dropout, he traveled widely in Europe [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46] and then in the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30], producing, en route, four other books, The Devil's Picture Book and The Wooden Horse, both of which are poetry, The Prince of Darkness, a novel, and a travel book called Polish Subtitles.  He is currently awaiting the publication of his next book of poetry, to be called Minutes, while teaching in the English department at the University of Chicago [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131252]. He says that his plans for the future are vague, but he assures me that they include the evasion of Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172]. Ladies and gentlemen, Daryl Hine.

I thought I'd begin by reading some poems that I wrote when I lived in Montreal...if I can find some fuel. Poems that are in my second book, which I tend to think of as my first book, The Carnal and the Crane. I'll read the third and fourth of four fabulary satires.

The other poem that I'll read from The Carnal and the Crane is a one-sided dialogue called ""A Bewilderment at the Entrance of the Fat Boy into Eden"". It's in four fairly distinct parts. They're more distinct than the ordinary stanzas in a poem.

A number of the poems in my next book, The Devil's Picture Book, were also written in Montreal, although the book was published about two years after I left Montreal and went to Europe. I'm going to read one of the longest poems in this book, which is called ""The Double-Goer"".

00:16:31
Immediately following that poem in The Devil's Picture Book, which I feel is very accurately titled, immediately after that poem is another much shorter, and...perhaps not really simpler poem on the same subject, the subject which seemed to preoccupy me a great deal at the time and I'm glad to say no longer does. This poem is a villanelle, and it's called ""The Black Swan"".

There's a...poem in The Wooden Horse that deals also, perhaps, I think, with the same subject, but in a different way, and at a different stage. It's called ""The Ouija Board"".  It may be that some of you don't know what an ouija board is, in any case, this one wasn't a real ouija board. We made it up using a teacup, an inverted, as I remember, cracked, willow-patterned teacup, on a round circular table top. Four of us operated this by placing a single finger each on the teacup, and we cut out letters of the alphabet and placed them around the table. I did this in company with a friend of mine who's done it for many years, and has developed such perfect communication with the other side that instead of getting the usual scrambled answers that people get in these attempted communications, he gets extremely long, involved, and very literate answers, rather in the style of his own prose writing....[audience laughter] which all purport, or most of them purport to come from a Greek or Roman character called, in this poem Io, he's actually called Ephraim, although perhaps I shouldn't mention it. Anyway, this is about a session with the teacup.

Four years ago I came back to Montreal on my first visit since I left rather quietly in 1958, and spent the next year after this return visit, which was very pleasant, although very brief, struggling with a poem which I think perhaps is still not quite finished, but I think will go either in this form or some other form into the next book. It's a poem, of course, about the impossibility of writing an autobiographical poem. And it's called ""The Apology"".

Well, I've returned to other places than Montreal [audience laughter], and two summers ago I went back just for the summer to Paris [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90], where I lived for something more than, between three and four years, and I didn't like it very much. And these are two poems from a series that I wrote about not liking it. This one is called ""The Marché aux Puces and the Jardin des Plantes""- the Marché aux Puces is of course the flea market, and the Jardin des Plantes is the botanical and zoological gardens, where I spent, in one place or other I spent most of my afternoons, that rather boring summer in Paris. Having the habit of working in the morning.

Well, I think perhaps I'll read three of these [inaudible]. The next one will seem familiar to, I'm sure, many of you. I haven't quite decided on a title, it might be called ""Jardin des Gourmets"", or it might be called ""Rendez-vous des routiers"" or something like that, it's about a certain sort of French restaurant.
 
Daryl Hine
00:38:42
Reads ""Le Rendezvous des Gourmets"" [published later in Minutes; audience laughter throughout].
 
Daryl Hine
00:40:18
And this poem isn't quite as funny [audience laughter], not that I really thought the last one was, but this one is really about Henry James' [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170509] novel, The Ambassadors [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q650571]. It's also, of course, about being in any town in the off season, in this case, Paris, and of course, Paris in August is emptier than anywhere I've ever been. But, I imagine that other places in their off seasons are the same. It's called ""Clôture annuelle"".

I also, this year, or was it last, returned to my place of origin, British Columbia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1974]. A [inaudible] which will be familiar to some of you as the site of the University of British Columbia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q391028], I don't mean the University by any of the architectural things I mention in this poem, but I'm talking about the beach, a very beautiful, barren Pacific beach that lies below Point Grey [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16898567].

Now, can you see over there? I'm still concerned about the situation of the lights. Light's one of the big problems in poetry. [Audience laughter]. This is ""Two Preludes for La Push"", and it’s dedicated to Michael Ross [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21280686]. It was written when I was teaching [Wetky's (?)] courses a couple of years ago in Seattle [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5083] for a couple of quarters. The physical beauty of the North West got me very involved and I wrote a number of poems about it, of which this was the first. La Push [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q554902], Washington [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1223] is a city on the coast--city, no it's a hamlet on the coast, very poverty stricken Indian populated, really a ruined community with dead cars lying around and houses falling apart, but in the summer many people come there because of its superb beauty. I found that I couldn't write about the Indian community, I wrote rather about the sea and myself.

I lived on a houseboat for a while, in Seattle, which I certainly think that everybody who considers going to Seattle ought to do. In fact, I was living on a houseboat when the tidal wave struck in the spring of that year. That is a marvelous thrill, it woke me up. I became friends with ducks there, I was living alone, and the poem is partly about that. ""Three Moves in Six Months"". You'll have to forgive me, I don't have this poem with me, I wanted to remember it, I'll see if I can.

I was just asked to read another, earlier poem, which I'm glad to do. Why not? I still like this poem. Then I'll come back and read some more recent things. Did we decide we'll try this without the lamp at all? I think we did, because it seems to get in the way of people. I think that people are more important than I am. Is that worse? Probably if you can't see me it should be marvelous. It’s called ""A Trip to Four or Five Towns"" and I dedicated it to James Wright [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6145850], simply because he liked it. There's a reference toward the end of the poem to a visit to William Carlos Williams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106], and there's also a reference to a story about e.e. cummings [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298703], told by Charles Norman in his biography of cummings about a long night spent at [Archebold (?)] and [unintelligible] with them living in France [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q142], cummings was working for the New York Herald Tribune [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q532494], I think, perhaps another New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] paper, there aren't that many. But on the way back from the party, cummings had the urge to take a leak, and so he did so, but it was Champs-Élysées [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q550] or some extraordinary [audience laughter] place like that and the cops saw him. They brought him to jail, and they said, 'You piss on Paris [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90]' [audience laughter]. He said, 'No ,it's not the point, I just had to take a leak', but they kept him there the whole night and when he finally got back to his office in the morning they had signs posted up around, which said--and I don't read French, I'm sorry because I know that many of you know French--but it was something like this, “[unintelligible] pisseur Americain”, which I guess translated ""Let the American pisser go"". [Audience laughter]. This was ""A Trip to Four or Five Towns”.

I realize reading the poem now how dated it is with the reference to the capital of [Viscount(?)] claim, which sold out some time ago to I don't know, somebody that sold out to somebody else. Williams by the way, did not read his Sixteen new poems, he had them, but he couldn't read them because he'd had a stroke and had never heard them. I visited him with Galway Kinnell [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2425705], and he asked us to read the poems, and we did. But I thought that, you know, one of the great things about poetry is that you can make it the way that it should be, so I had him read the poems. This is ""Big Sur: Partington Cove"". I went with a couple of students to, well we were in the Big Sur [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q859413], and this is a very hidden place, Partington Cove [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21551591]. A marvelous place, accessible only by a tunnel shored up by ancient timbers, I feel I am sort of repeating the poem by telling you this, but there is such a cove, and you can only reach it through a tunnel, it's very beautiful. Smugglers used the cove and a cave nearby to hide booze during the prohibition, it was used for other purposes before and since, and there are--well why not? [Audience laughter]. But you can't get there at all now, I tried to revisit when I was back there last spring, but it's all roped off. And even the one time I did get to go there, there was a sign that was supposed to scare you away. The, one of the motivating things behind the poem was my understanding for the first time of what happens in some paintings that a friend of mine Jim Johnson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100239918] does, where he uses combinations of landscape and the human body. He will have for example, mountains coming off an arm, and the figure of a clown. I had an experience which this poem talks about that made me see for the first time the kind of rapport between body and landscape. It was important to me, and part of what happens to the poem.

The name of the town is Herkimer [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3134036], New York [audience laughter] and I guess I won't go into the background of it, it's not that interesting.

Good evening. Hello, Mr. Bowering [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280]. [Audience laughter]. Well, welcome to the sixth reading of our second series of evenings with Canadian and American poets. Tonight we have Joe Rosenblatt [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1691575], Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172], and John Newlove [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6250356], formerly of Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639], now residing in Nova Scotia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1952]. Joe Rosenblatt will begin the reading, there will be an intermission, and John Newlove will follow. I'm going to quote largely from the copy in Joe Rosenblatt's book, The LSD Leacock, for I hope servient biographical information. It goes like this, he was born in Toronto on December the 26th, nineteen hundred and thirty-three. He says that he has suffocated in Toronto ever since then. He attended the Central Technical School [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5061898] and dropped out in Grade 10, he has worked as a grave-digger, plumber's helper, civil servant, railway express misanthrope. He has attended the Provincial Institute of Trades where he acquired a diploma as a welder fitter, his favourite writers are Ambrose Biers, William Blake [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513], Emily Dickinson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4441], and A.M. Klein [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2778027], and his favourite dream, is Cyclops turning up at a [nigh-bank (?)]. [Audience laughter]. His previous book of poems, which was probably printed in nineteen hundred and sixty-three, is called Voyage of the Mood. Joe Rosenblatt.

Wasn't that [unintelligible]. I'm just going to read, start off with a series of poems I had written about my uncle, who was a fishmonger. He had a habit of phyxiating and murdering fish, and slicing them, and slicing them, and...well, I'll start. This is called ""Uncle Nathan: Blessed his memory, speaketh in land-locked green"".

I wrote all kinds of poems. I was in Vancouver and I came across the god-awful logic of the zoo. It kinda scared the hell out of me. It was a bat. I've never seen a bat before. Met people who were bats. But this was the real McCoy, it was a fruit bat and it was hanging upside-down, you know, that's the way they live and they fornicate that way too, apparently, upside-down. So I wrote about bats. I have some more fish poems but I get tired of that after a while, you start hating it. And we'll begin with ""Bats"". While it's true the bat is a mammal, not a bird, there's all types of kinds of mythology based on prejudice about bats and which I've tried to embody in these poems.

Outside of the bat poem there came a group of sound poetry. Because I tried to get the feeling of the bat in the air, you know the image of the bat and the way it, and the movements of the bat. And this is called ""The Fruit Bat"". First encounter with a bat.

""The Zombie"". Just whistle when you get tired of these bat poems. Do anything you wanna do. ""The Zombie"". By the way, bats are supposed to be unkosher according to Leviticus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41490]. It says all fowl that creep going upon all fours shall be an abomination unto you. But in other countries they're great appetizers, the fruit bat especially, and I have an interesting poem, not right now though. ""The Zombie"".

I wrote a poem to Che Guevara [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5809], if I can find the thing now, because I really muddled everything up here, oh here it is.

Roy Kiyooka
00:00:00
Well, it gives me a very special kind of pleasure to introduce John Newlove. An old and dear friend. We met in the fall of '61 in Vancouver, and both of us had come from Saskatchewan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1989] to Vancouver. I think that some of John's most memorable early poems have to do with the fact of Saskatchewan.  It's perhaps not an exaggeration to say that the place does continue to haunt him, and hopefully that the exorcism is not complete and that we may get some more Saskatchewan poems. Subsequently, and this is still in Vancouver, we shared a studio, or rather, he shared my studio [audience laughter], for a period of little over a year. Now during this time, we played marathon games of chess, ate several hundred dozens of chocolate-coated Long Johns, scribbled poems, dribbled paint, drank cheap red wine...and read through at least a dozen five-foot shelves of great and lesser works of literature, not to mention the confusion of mice, drunken poets, women, painters, and assorted kooks who kept visiting us. Now, it was during this period that his first book, called Grave Sirs was printed, and I have in italics here ""more or less."" If you want to know the history of that book, you can ask John. I think there must be fifty odd copies that are still unbound someplace. This was printed by Robert Reed. It was followed by a second, called Elephants, Mothers, and Others, done by Tak Tanabe, again in Vancouver, and subsequent to that, it was rumored that Robert Columbo had discovered John Newlove for Canadian poetry [audience laughter], when he collected some of his works together in an anthology called Poetry '64. Now. Following this, of course, Contact Press bought out his book, Moving in Alone, which was perhaps the book that brought him his first large-scale critical attention. Meanwhile, of course, I'd come here, and some time afterwards I received a book, a wee book, called...let's see. [Audience laughter]. Can't read my own printing here. What They Say. Yes, What They Say is a wee book of poems, it's made up of the rejects from his manuscript that he submitted to McClelland and Stewart [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6800322]. McClelland and Stewart is to bring out his next book of poems called Black Night Window, when they get around to doing it. The manuscript has been in their hands for over twenty-four months. There has been much other activity which include three, two years and a third one coming up as poet in residence at Deep Springs [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5250324] in California [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99]. I want to conclude this little preamble by saying that at the time that John moved out of our studio, I took over this room that he slept in and wrote poetry in. The mattress in this room was about sixteen inches from the floor, and on two sides, on the wall, there was copious scribbling.  Most of it were quotations from Heraclitus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41155] that he was reading at that time.
 
Audience
00:04:43
Applause.
 
John Newlove
00:04:51
They weren't quotations from whoever, whatever Greek name that was you just made up, [audience laughter], they were from Herodotus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26825]. And, Roy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789] might have mentioned that, while I suppose technically you could say I was sharing the studio, I was paying half the rent.  Almost half the rent. I was paying some rent. [Audience laughter]. And he never mentioned who won most of the chess games. I write a lot of...who's throwing things at me?  You didn't win any chess games. [Audience laughter]. And you weren't paying any rent, either. I write a lot of poems about dreams, one night I woke up with a dream about an Australian chief and I managed to write down most of it. It's called ""The Almost King"".
 
John Newlove
00:05:42
Reads ""The Almost King"" [audience laughter throughout].

John Newlove
00:08:32
Well, when you have dreams like that, you don't really have much chance. I've a number of short poems, I'm told it's not good to give them at poetry readings because people don't listen fast enough or something. But. [Laughter]. This...Yes, that ashtray is stolen from the faculty club, George, and your wife stole it. [Audience laughter]. This one is called ""The Candle"".
 
John Newlove
00:09:07
Reads ""The Candle"".
 
John Newlove
00:09:19
Again a dream. This poem, misprinted in the Malahat Review [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1567225], is one that I most like. It's called ""The Engine and the Sea"".
 
John Newlove
00:09:32
Reads ""The Engine and the Sea"" [published later in The Cave and in The Fat Man].
 
John Newlove
00:11:26
Love poems about sleep. And about dreams. This one is called ""Before Sleep"". I used to have a great deal of trouble going to sleep because I was afraid I would have nightmares.
 
John Newlove
00:11:44
Reads ""Before Sleep"" [later published in The Cave and in The Fat Man].
 
John Newlove
00:12:53
And again another one about dreams, this one called ""The Dream Man”. Dreamed I once wrote a dream about somebody else's dream, but that's not fair, dreams are copyright. This was my own. [Audience laughter].
 
John Newlove
00:13:09
Reads ""The Dream Man"".
 
John Newlove
00:14:35
According to the rules, you're supposed to say things in between poems, but I can't really ever think of anything appropriate to say in between them, so. I used to have some nice Ed Sullivan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83807] routines, but I've forgotten them. This poem is called ""Burn"".
 
John Newlove
00:14:52
Reads ""Burn"".
 
John Newlove
00:15:16
And this one, an old one, again fairly short. It's called ""No Song"".
 
John Newlove
00:15:25
Reads ""No Song"" [from Black Night Window and published later in The Fat Man].
 
John Newlove
00:15:47
I have a poem I wrote for and about a friend, but after the poem was finished as you may see, I showed it to him but I didn't tell him it was about him. He said it was a very good poem and very accurate, and so on. But he didn't know it was about himself. It's called, ""What do you want, what do you want?"".
 
John Newlove
00:16:06
Reads ""What do you want, what do you want?"" [from Black Night Window and later published in The Fat Man; audience laughter and applause throughout].
  
John Newlove
00:17:01
After he said it was such an accurate poem, I couldn't tell him it was about him. This one's called ""Strand by Strand"".
 
John Newlove
00:17:14
Reads ""Strand by Strand"".
 
John Newlove
00:17:56
This is the first time I've kept to a list of...because usually I decide that I don't want to read a particular poem and I get all confused, but I'm very pleased with myself when I keep right to the schedule. Everything organized, everything complete. This short poem in five naturally short pieces is called ""One Day"".
 
John Newlove
00:18:23
Reads ""One Day"".
 
John Newlove
00:18:55
Charles Williams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124735] died in about 1953, he was an Englishman, originally Cockney. He wrote a number of what I think are very good poems, a number of detective novels, some theological deputation, I guess would be the right word. One of his detective novels is about finding the holy grail. It's called War in Heaven and it's out in Faber Paperback, go and buy it, it's really nice. This poem is for and from and about Charles Williams.
 
John Newlove
00:19:35
Reads “For and From Charles Williams” [from What They Say].
 
John Newlove
00:20:04
Now my list has gone to pot, because I've got a poem down in a magazine that I didn't bring. So. One day some years ago, I was hitchhiking out to British Columbia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1974]. I got to a place called Golden [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1020179], B.C. and I had to go up the Big Bend Highway [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30253222], this would be before the Rogers Pass [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q383051] was open. And I got a ride about thirty miles in on what I didn't know was an illegally-present logging truck, because the Big Bend Highway was not open to traffic for three more days. So I sat three days on the Big Bend Highway. This poem roughly...well, it's called ""Solitaire"".
 
John Newlove
00:20:47
Reads ""Solitaire"" [from Black Night Window and published later in The Fat Man].
 
John Newlove
00:21:22
This short one called ""El Paso"" because El Paso was the place where it happens. It was ninety degrees outside in El Paso [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16562], and with the air conditioning, which I couldn't turn off, it was about thirty below. And I couldn't sleep, I had to get up in the middle of the night and get dressed and get under the blankets, and I caught terrible cold in that motel. 
 
John Newlove
00:21:41
Reads ""El Paso"".
 
John Newlove
00:21:56
Since I've been out of Nova Scotia, I've written a couple of poems about or around Nova Scotia. The main thing I can't seem to get in a poem just yet is the difference between the Pacific Ocean [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q98], in Vancouver, and the Atlantic [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q97]. There seems a tremendous difference that I can feel but that I can't seem yet to grasp in the fact. This poem is called ""God Bless You"".
 
John Newlove
00:22:24
Reads ""God Bless You"" [later published in The Cave and in The Fat Man].
 
Audience
00:22:43
Laughter.
 
John Newlove
00:22:47
The next piece is on the back of my list. I think this is about the only other ethnic Nova Scotia-type poem that I've got, but I was only there for about six months and I can't quite put out a book yet. This is called ""By the Grey Atlantic"".
 
John Newlove
00:23:04
Reads ""By the Grey Atlantic"" [published later in The Cave and in The Fat Man].
 
John Newlove
00:23:31
I think I'll read quickly a number of poems from this book. I'm anxious not to keep you too long, if anybody feels like walking out, I won't really be insulted if you'll [unintelligible]. These are all quite simple so I might as well just give the title in my school-class fashion and then go on to read them. This is called ""The Photograph my Mother Keeps"". I might see first that Veregin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7921203] is a town in Saskatchewan named after a leader of the Doukhobors [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5302215], they first came to that area after Peter the Lordly Verigin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4107818] [unintelligible] his palace, which is really just a gigantic farmhouse, it's outside the town. 
 
John Newlove
00:24:19

This one is called ""Sister Cowen"". She used to run a mission in Edmonton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2096], and she had very good stew. She was a very violent woman. On Christmas Eve she used to give all the bums fifty cents, but she gave a particularly long sermon on Christmas Eve. She was very down on booze.

I think it's, it's either redundant or futile to do anything more than the formality of introducing Earle Birney [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3046415] who's probably the most famous poet we've ever had and who you will see described on those pieces of paper, pink that flit around, as always as a, the Dean of Canadian Poetry, though I prefer to think of him as the federal Minister for Poetry, and the times he has been a semi-official courier of Canadian poetry around the world. Sadly enough, as he tells me, the only book of his still generally in print is the Selected Poems of 1966, which we do have on sale outside the door and of which, I should remind you, he gets a cut from his publisher. [Audience laughter]. Luckily there, I have, have heard that there will be a couple of Birney books within the next little while, one of them published in the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] and the other one by the Coach House Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5137585], presuming always that there will be a Coach House Press in the next little while. I would just like to mention that my association with Earle Birney has always been very, a good one, for me, and I wouldn't be here today to be talking about him unless I happened to be a member of the Poetry Committee, and, except that if it hadn't been for him, and the fact that both he and I were in Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639] at one time, I probably wouldn't have been writing any poems at all. Either that, or he would be writing mine. So without any further ado, and probably to our great delectation, I would like to introduce Earle Birney.

Thank you very much, George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280]. I should, in all fairness to George, say that he actually wrote all this information about me and probably a good number of the poems, which I will be reading under my own name tonight. I would also like to say that I have, was recently corresponding with a man who had just resigned as president of a University to become a Dean of another University and had said, well, at least I will show them that if a Dean is a mouse in training to be a rat, then some rats can revert to being mice. Now, if we apply this to the world of poetry, I would say that I am a mouse in training to be less than a mouse, to be something in another category--I think I'd like to be Bursar of Canadian Poetry. But nobody has really set me up for that. I'm going to start by making sure that I read one good poem tonight by reading a poem of W. B. Yeats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213] [audience laughter] called ""A Prayer for Old Age"", which has, I think, I'm afraid, more and more pertinence to my condition. He wrote it at 69.

That I will use as an excuse for some of the poems I now shall read you, if I can find my list. The last thing. Ah yes, here it is. Now there's no mic and I want to make sure that everyone is hearing me. If I'm not talking loud enough, those that cannot hear, would you please put a hand up now. I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry--well, you will have to go to the back and then somebody who's standing can come here. I'm sorry there aren't, that some of you have to stand, and I'll try to make it as fast as possible so we can all get out of here. [Audience laughter]. I'm going to begin with some poems that are, alas, too well known to my fellow poets, most of them in this room, but I had planned it this way and I'm stuck with it now and so are they. I'm going to begin with a series that came out, some members of a series that came out in Ice Cod Bell or Stone, and later others in, Near False Creek Mouth, that have to do with wandering around the global village, and this one begins in, well it since begins in Vancouver, but it's about Honolulu [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18094]. I got a fellowship to go to England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21] and I was in Vancouver and I discovered that it only cost me two hundred dollars and some odd cents more to go to London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84] and back to Vancouver by way of going around the world, you know, just heading west. The air tickets were accommodating me that way. So I decided to go west, and my first stop, I noticed, was Honolulu, and I began to get a bit of a temperature about that, and I thought, how 'bout, I might as well live it up, I'm going to Honolulu tomorrow morning, going to be there tomorrow night, and so I will engage a room in Hawaiian Village Hotel for the one night, because first night, I know I have a little money. After that, God knows what's going to happen to me because I intend to stay in a lot of places before I get to London. So I did this, I reserved a room before I left Vancouver, not realizing that this had put me in a bit of a box, because this is one of the Kaiser-Hilton hotels on Waikiki Beach [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254861], and they have a special greeter who meets all the planes, just for people coming to them. And it happened, through another mischance, that I was the only one for that hotel, and this unsettled me so much I had to write about it. [Audience laughter]. Something which I call ""Twenty-Third Flight"" for reasons, well, the poem is imitative of another poet, much older, much greater, by the name of David. Not the one that I pushed off the cliff [audience laughter], the one who was a harpist.

Thank you very much, I hesitate to look as if I anticipated more applause, but I would much prefer it if you'd just let me rattle ahead here, for one thing it's getting hotter in here and more and more uncomfortable and as I say, let me get ahead with it, and so if at the end, of course, if anybody is still here with enough energy left, fine. Is there anybody who knows where water is available, any water hole out there in those vast cement deserts?

Yeah! ...Well, while George is away I'll read one of his poems. This one is called ""Honolulu"" and follows immediately after the other, but in between was about forty, twenty-four hours, I guess, in which I visited the very famous outdoor aviary, one of the world's famous aviaries, and also the aquarium and so on, and I also encountered a type, a Honolulu type of sorts. So this poem, which is perhaps about the involvement of people with animals through self-projection, and the involvement of human animals with each other.

But I think I'm going to leave Asia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48] for the moment, and get on to Europe [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46], briefly, been around to Spain [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29], at any rate. I was sitting, more or less minding my own business, on a plaza in Madrid [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2807] one morning, having my coffee, and something happened, which again I felt I should chronicle. Desmond Pacey [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5264782] says I'm a chronicler, and so I, having learned that, I now use the word [audience laughter] to explain what I'm doing. I renamed the plaza, it had a rather dull name, I call it Plaza de Inquisicion.

I also went to the Prado [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q160112] of course, and saw, for the first time, the original of one of the three studies by El Greco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q301] of The Espolio [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q52301456], or the taking-off and rending of Christ's garments, which was one of El Greco's themes. And I was struck, as I had never been really before, I suppose because I never had really looked at these paintings properly, I had looked at them in small illustrations--I was struck by the extraordinary amount of space which had been taken up, which El Greco had devoted to the carpenter who was making the holes in the cross preparatory to having Christ nailed to the cross. In fact, the whole lower third of the canvas is devoted to him in one of these three versions, and not only that but he is, they're facing us, with his back to Christ, and on the right and left are two of the Marys, whose eyes are on him. I felt that perhaps El Greco was trying to say something here, apart from what he was saying about the actual scene of the crucifixion, in a symbolic way, perhaps about something that happened to do, really, with this religion, but with, whatever we'd call it, religion, whatever we'd call it, of art. Or if not of art, but craft. It's a little, perhaps, exaggerated, to call the carpenter an artist, but it's obvious that he'd been very much at that moment a craftsman. And so I wrote ""El Greco: Espolio"".

When I come to Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16], now, I'm going to kind of sneak in on the side by reading you a poem that has to do with a very remote, I suppose the most remote part of Canada, in fact, the piece of land that is even nearer to the North Pole [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q934] than Greenland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223] or anything the Russians have, Ellesmereland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q146841]. And I will read it first of all in English, and then, more or less for the hell of it, I'm going to read it in a translation into Spanish, but anyway, because I think I like the sound of it in Spanish. It's short, so I've practiced my Spanish on it, and maybe I won't make too many boobs.

Well I'll get down and turn to more familiar territory. ""Canada Case History"". This is a poem written quite a long time ago, in 1945, in fact, when I'd just got back from World War Number Two [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q362], I always have to be careful to name which one it is, people getting confused about how far back I go now. And I found that in 1967 I had to do a little patching and changing of this, because history had not only caught up with me, it had changed me. But here, first of all is the original. No, I don't think, I can't, I don't think I can bear to read the original, I think I'll just read you what, what happened to this poem in 1967 in the centennial year.

This is something to my publisher, when they brought out a book of mine, Ice Cod Bell or Stone, full of beautiful artwork, except that the man in charge of the artwork had never read the little poem, the ""Klein Ellesmereland"" that I've just read to you, and so never discovered that when I was talking about bells, I was talking about harebells, or flowers, and he put very large iron church bells into all the illustrations. [Audience laughter]. I had asked to see the artwork in advance and was told that the authors, that this was not the custom to show authors the artwork in advance, so I didn't see it. So all I could do at the end was write something. ""To the reader”, which was not included in the volume.

Or ever will, I think. But Al has used it, and the country, and developed it into part of the remarkable fineness of his poetry.

Well those ten lines, each of five syllables, came out of a computer at the University of Waterloo [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1049470] last week, into which we had programmed a hundred and eleven, the one hundred and eleven words of George Meredith's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90238] ""Lucifer in Starlight,"" and the last thirty-three words of Archibald MacLeish's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q633354] ""The End of the World."" Don't ask me why we picked those two poems, I had nothing to do with the picking of the poems. But some of us, two linguists, two linguist-isists, a mathematician, and myself, and masses of computers are producing this sort of poetry. It took point eight-three seconds, not even one second, to produce the hundred-some-odd lines, out of which I chose those ten. So you can see it doesn't take very long, once you've programmed the machine, to find the, you know, the entire text of Hamlet [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41567], but this is what we have done so far, we haven't put too much time on it yet. Some things that I haven't had computers write for me, although perhaps I might have, or should have. This one's called ""Kooks of the Monk"".

Well now I'm going to turn back to older poems. To conclude. Hum...I'm going to read two or three poems that, who have some relationship to California [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99] and Oregon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q824]. First of all, a poem that, when I wrote it, I wrote it on the day of its date. I thought the date was going to be very significant. August the seven, 1964, Florence [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q862740], Oregon. And that was because on that day, the American fleet moved into the coast and shelled the coast of North Vietnam [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q881], against the international agreements into which the United States had entered some years before. And I thought that this would surely go down in living memory, as a deed of aggression and perfidy. But there have been so many since, almost every day, that everybody has forgotten about that first shelling of the shore from the Gulf of Tonkin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q212428]. But I happened to be on the shore of the Pacific [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q98] almost directly across from the Gulf of Tonkin, in fact, the waves that were coming in perhaps had their pulsing first on the other side. And this, one couldn't get it out of one's mind, having seen the morning papers and heard the radio, and I went, I had gone fishing with an American poet and his two boys. The salmon were running, coming in, but I have got less and less interested in killing even fish as I get older and softer, and I soon gave up even wanting to cook fish, and left it to the others, and I went up, because I had nothing to do then, I went up and I sat on a cliff, and started thinking about the sea out there, and cormorants fishing, and once in a while the flash of a seal coming up, also fishing, and I also suddenly realized I was sitting there just staring out at the sea and I began to think, I remembered Frost's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q168728] poem about how odd human beings are, you know, they go down to the sea and they sit and they all, they always look out at the sea, although they can't look very far out or very far in. And I thought that was exactly what I was feeling, the whole thing. But I thought well it's not really Frost's ocean, this is Robinson Jeffers' [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q734955] ocean, and here is this great eye of indifference, so I began my poem, called ""Looking from Oregon"" with a line from Robinson Jeffers about the Pacific: ""And what it watches is not our wars"".

Brought them as far as the hotel, but I forgot to bring them up here.  o you'll just have to visualize a poem shaped like a pair of stairs but coming up at you, and visualize yourself at the top of these stairs with your back against the side of a theatre, a campus theatre at the University of Oregon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q766145], with signs of last week's shows, this one to go on tonight, that I'm waiting to go into, waiting for my friends, who have the tickets, and watching people come up these steps, the cars coming by and discharging people.

Then I was driving along the coast, a long time, and I was confronted with a sign that hadn't been there before. A billboard, with the same message multiplied up and down the coast and everywhere I went, since the last time I was there. Now I, this is my favourite state of the American Union, Oregon, absolutely beautiful, still, despite whatever, all the attempts of man to un-beautify it, there's still this great volcanic, snow-covered mountains, such, shaped a bit like Fujiyama [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39231], there is also all those beautiful rocks and sea-lion caves and the pounding surf and the rhododendrons, the whole works. And there's these, this sign saying, ""Billboards Build Freedom of Choice, Courtesy of Oregon Chamber of Commerce"". I brooded about this, and being alone, I couldn't get the answer. What is the philosophy behind this? So I invented a hitchhiker, and I picked him up, and he told me, and this is what he said. This poem is dated 61-62, and Khruschev [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35314] is still in power in Russia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q159].

Well it's all part, it's like, poetry is like guidebooks, you know, guidebooks are always pointing out irrational connections between things, and so is poetry, so sometimes they get together, and in this case the guidebook had told me that there were two things, sort of, that this place was famous for, and I had discovered they were right.

A poem addressed to friend and writer George Lamming [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1340511], who's perhaps best known for his autobiography of his child as a poor negro boy on the island of Barbados [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q244]. George Lamming who wrote In the Castle of My Skin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23307454], and who happened to be in Jamaica [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q766] when I went there, and was extremely hospitable to me, and so were all his friends. And when I left I wrote him this poem, which had to do with a split-second feeling, something, thing happening inside me, an internal happening, the night of the last party, the last night of the last party.

Now I'm going to conclude with two pieces. One is about the farthest back of these poems. Although some things I've read tonight began earlier but have been revised, this one has not been particularly revised. It's called ""The Road to Nijmegen"" and was written in Holland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55] in January of 1945, the last winter of the war. Which was the coldest winter, and in this part of Holland, first the Germans in coming and then in retreating had cut down every tree anywhere around. The trees were used for fuel and for mine props and...And then we had come in, and if there were any trees left, we'd got them. And in fact, it was no longer a matter of trees, it was a matter of trying to find bits and pieces of coal and getting the coal working and getting the coal out of the hands of black marketeers. And meantime the people were cold, even colder than we were, and they also lacked food. This is a letter home to a friend.

""And I'd like to just simply move from that to a poem which is called, ""Dandelion"". It's a poem that, well, the daughter of a famous poet likes it very much, and she recently said so, and so consequently I'm very fond of it at the moment. I think this is a kind of procedure among artists. They tend to like very much, at least for a little while, something that someone else likes. It's a poem which I say partially for my wife, it's a poem of affection, but I wouldn't just simply say ""for"" my wife, it's for all of you, too. ""Dandelion"".""

I visited once a grotto in the southern coast of Italy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38], the Amalfi [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80563] grotto, and it's typical of a whole series of such places. It's completely enclosed. You enter it...well actually, I was there a year ago, and it's a little disappointing, because, to sort of accommodate the tourist trade, they've blown out a little section of the wall, and they've hung a flapping canvas cloth over it. But eleven years ago this wasn't so, and you descend in an elevator into this inner room, and it's an absolutely magic place, it's explained to you, for instance, that about sixteen feet under the level of the sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38882], there's a large hole in the cave, and the sunlight, particularly in the morning, you come there about 11 in the morning, it's a good time, the sun filters down these sixteen feet and through this huge hole and then comes up inside the cafe. And the effect of this is absolutely eerie because it's completely enclosed, it's like darkness, but you get in there, and you adjust, and everything is just luminous with light, water, everything. You pick up, and you dip your hands in water and pick them up, you know, drops of water fall from your fingers from the orb-blades that splash, the orb is simply just a whole splash of light that goes up, like that. It's magic, see. And I want to believe in the magic, but in this sense I want to believe in this way in poetry. We shouldn't, I think, just simply deceive ourselves, but....so we can talk about what is, but somehow it's a responsibility to do a little bit more than what is, and so I've written this poem, and of course it's about the Amalfi Grotto, it's about our own behaviour, an attitude toward many things, and it's also, for me, a poem about poetry. """"The Amalfi Grotto"".""

""I would go from that to a poem for my brother. I call the poem ""War"". This was a brother who was killed in the Philippines [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q928] in World War II. I was in Europe at the time. I wrote thirty poems, at least, for him, following this. And finally I wrote this poem. This was...about eleven years afterwards when I got to this poem. And with this poem I knew I was, I was through writing those poems. It's also a poem that's had a very curious history. The history of poems is something that's difficult to predict. I was in Germany at the time, I suppose the next German soldier I met I would have shot. But this poem has been seen, or was seen a few years ago by a former infantry officer in the German Army, who at that moment was a captive at Stalingrad [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q914]. He's come into the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] now and teaches music in an American university, not the one I'm in. And so he set it to music. And so it's a strange irony. I started the whole sequence, see, but, see art pays no attention to that kind of enmity whatsoever. And so it's been set to music by a former infantry officer in the German army. Also, just this past week, actually two days ago, I got a notice it's been published in a Japanese anthology, and it's been translated into Italian, and so all the axis powers have translated it, and then somehow, I don't, still don't know how, it found its way after the Hungarian Revolution [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q164348] into Budapest [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1781] in '56, and got translated there, I understand a very poor translation into Hungarian, but nevertheless it's happened. This is just part of its history. And other things have been happening to it strangely like this. I just mention this because, see, at a certain point the thing is out of your control completely, and you sort of are, I feel a bit humbled by what happens to them, and the uses that people put these things to. I wrote poems in all sorts of forms for my brother, and I finally, there're some subjects...well, I'd heard William Carlos Williams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106] give a reading at the Lexington Y in New York City [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] in 1954, and so I said, okay, I was still dealing with the same poem, and I was in an apartment up in 96th Street, and it was a very foggy night coming home, and I heard all these great foghorns coming off over the lower bay, over Manhattan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11299] and so forth. And I wrote another poem, ""A Seachange for Harold"", which I'm not going to read, except just the beginning.""

""Reads the beginning of ""A Seachange: For Harold"" [fromThe Green Town and collected later in Selected Poems].""

Joseph Langland
00:16:40
Well that's, I wrote that thing first, and then I came back to this other poem, in which I just said, okay I'll put it down the way it was, but there's some subjects that by their very nature you can't do much about. Except, of course, the whole dry feeling associated with it led me to all kinds of selections. If there seem to be an excess of family in the poem, I just simply say I am one of nine children.

""I would go from that to some poems I'm trying to write now. Some of these poems are songs, and I've been writing music for them, also, but, and this is such a song. I call it ""A Hard Song to Sing"", and it's really about the contemporary condition of war and civil rights problems which threaten to just overwhelm the United States. And almost the entire poem is monosyllabic, but it just seemed like it had to be that way. So. I...and actually, the tune that goes with this thing is...well, I know for instance that I could come in right on pitch on it. I once fell in love with--I don't have absolute pitch, but I fell in love with a song by Edward Grieg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80621], and all I have to do is remember this song and I can always begin singing in A flat. But, it's, sometimes I think that maybe this is what I mean by being so right with your subject that you finally say the right thing about it. Somehow the resonance, just the resonance of the idea set up in my body brings me in on pitch, see. Well, I'll just read it. ""The clear, cold night""...oh I'll sing, I'll sing the one stanza.""

I...when I spent some time in Europe, among other people I met Ralph Ellison [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q299965]. And he and his wife, Fanny, and my wife, Judy, and I, we spent several very fine noons on a beach of a small Italian fishing town, and ever since then I've been trying to write a poem for him. He's been relatively silent, at least, he's not taken a very aggressive role in the whole civil rights movement, although he has published significant essays in that whole thing. Many of you will know his great novel The Invisible Man [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1784288]. And ""I've written a poem, I call it ""An Open Letter to Ralph Ellison"", I'm reading it, I have to send it to him. I have not sent it out to be published anywhere, either. You probably do know he used to be a jazz player, he played the trumpet, he was a photographer and so forth and he did live in some sort of cellar that he had brilliantly lit for a while, but in The Invisible Man there are aspects of this kind of background, too. So I just wanted to address--I started writing him a letter. And then I got interested in writing in the letter and quit the letter and wrote the poem instead, but that's the way it'd be. It was ""Dear Ralph"", you know but just, now the poem begins, ""Ralph...""""

Joseph Langland
00:27:02
Well, I will move from that to a poem on Thoreau [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131149]. Actually, I'm doing a whole book of these things. But one...actually, the first time I ever went to Walden Pond [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2023853], things turned out like an art farm. There were certain people there, and I met people in certain sequences, and of course I've told all sorts of people that, when they write poetry, you know, just to say that this is the way it happened, or this is the way it was, you know, that's no guarantee that it will be art at all. But in this case, something else had happened, see, Thoreau himself plays influence and just simply organized, you know, a hundred years later, certain people who would be there. And this happened just this way, and so I, almost to defend myself against all the things I'd ever said to people, I called the poem, """"How It, So Help Me, Was"""". And that's the title of the poem. I end with a, the blue-grey twilight, because it was 1963, and it was, or '62 when I went there, and it was, you know, a hundred years after the war between the North and the South in the United States, the blue and the grey. And I felt that whole shadow, and even, in a curious way, it's on the west end of the pond, actually, I'd gone swimming in it, it's illegal, but then the shadow was coming off the hill and it was just sort of beginning to cover, to cover me, and it was a blue-grey shadow, you see, I'm not making that up. And, but...I suppose that's a kind of selection you take out of what is made available to you at a certain point. So """"How It, So Help me, Was"""".

I know at a time like this I keep thinking all the time in poetry, you know, what does it mean in poetry to somehow keep alive, or...to keep the whole body open, and I wanted to write a poem about that. I call this one """"Still to be Man"""". Because sort of in an animal way, we have to be able to continue to take in all sorts of things.

Last year, I spent, with my family, a half a year in Rome [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q220], and I got acquainted with a certain kind of syndrome among some of the Roman women. They sort of get trapped, in a society which seems free and easy and open, there's an extreme conservatism. For instance, I know, well, a person who teaches art in an American university, he and his wife were adopting some children in Italy a few years ago, and he could not have children and she could. It was proved by tests in this country, and they went to adopt two children in Italy. But you cannot adopt children in Italy on this basis because by law, no man in Italy can be sterile. [Audience laughter]. And this is a law. And so they had to go to Naples [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2634] and be tested all over again, officially, by a doctor in Naples, and a lawyer had to follow this, and they discovered after the tests that she was sterile and she was not [audience laughter], and they got this all certified and they adopted the children and they now have them and are living happily with them. But there's some, there's another side to this coin, too. And so, we lived next to a high school called the church, or the school of the Adorazione, and I'd see this women, you know, they're so beautiful when they're young, and then when they get married they start dressing in black and start cooking spaghetti and having children, and something awful happens, and then their husbands lose interest in them and then they have to find other lovers and then, you know, it's an awful thing. [Audience laughter]. It's ""La Donna a Roma, an Odyssey"".

00:37:24
Well then, another kind of thing that happens in our society, I think it happens to many people, I've been writing a series of half-songs. I call them half-songs, they're at half-pitch, half-singing pitch, where we talk and we don't talk together. You know, we say something and someone answers and it goes, you know, we keep going past each other. And so I've written a poem that, it has two separate parts, both parts rhyme all the way but you won't hear this at all, I was talking about that with the class here, today, it may be aesthetically valid for myself alone. And it's one, it's called ""Not Quite a Conversation: A Half-Song"", and the first part is called ""He and Her"". You see, ""he"" is the noun and ""her"" is the object. And the next part is called, ""She and Him"". ""She"" is the noun and ""him"" is the object. And they're talking. Or, we're talking about them. And so, in a sense they should be printed facing each other on the page, and I can't read them together, so I have to read first ""He and Her"", then I might, they talk back and forth to each other all the way through the poem. ""He and Her.""

And, I will read just one or two of these. And once again, I make no particular claim as to the validity of this, and probably in the long run it’s not even a fruitful thing. All my grandparents were born in Norway [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20], my name is Langeland. You know, they dropped the 'e' and called it Langland. And I have been back there a couple of times, I might go again this summer and work with a Norwegian poet, Paul Brekke, and maybe another one, on some translations from the Norwegian  I don't know much Norwegian, he knows a lot of English. [Audience laughter]. But when I was going through there a year ago, I got two, two poems. First this one, ""Singing in Late Summer"". When my father died they played a folk song, ""Den store hvide Flok"", ""The Great White Host"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10468796], at his funeral. And I'd sort of shipped my children off to jobs, I had, you know, I had a fourteen-year-old boy working on a ranch in Wyoming [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1214], and a twelve-year-old son working on a farm in Iowa, and a daughter who'd gone off to work in-- who was what, fifteen, sixteen, to a hotel in Switzerland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39], and my wife was in Provincetown [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49154], painting [audience laughter], and I was at home writing. Which is what I wanted to do all the time, in any case. ""Singing in Late Summer"".

And then, traveling through Norway, all these rivers, you know, they just...they're tumbling all over, rushing everywhere, and falling off the tops of mountains, you know, it just seemed endless, going from Oslo to Bergen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26793] and Trondheim [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25804] and down to Oslo and so forth. Or down to the Island of Store [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1636366] along the west coast of Norway. And so, I was thinking of a phrase I'd heard an old, an older woman in my own area say about the younger generation. She would always say, ""[inaudible phrase in Norwegian]"". And so I saw these rivers, and every time I saw them I kept saying, ""[inaudible phrase in Norwegian]"". [Laughter]. And so then I started thinking of all of these Norwegian immigrants that just came, you know, more of them over here than there are over there...and...so I, it's about the rivers, it's called ""Norwegian Rivers"", and it's about the people, the younger people, and it's about the immigrants, and the older immigrants, everything like that, I guess.

I'm...you know, I'm translating from the Russian, and no pretense about it, I have two great friends, Thomas Axel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23565070], who was press agent for Imre Nagy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177917] for eleven days, before, at the time of the Hungarian Revolution, and then he escaped to Austria [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40]. He teaches at my university, he's a very fine poet, he used to be a director of theatre in Budapest, of the State Theatre. And then Laszlo Ticosz, he teaches in the German-Russian department at the university. They both, for years, have been collecting from the underground poems by relatively unknown poets, student poets and so forth, from Russia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q159], and they have a magnificent collection of these things. They give me, absolutely literal cribbed translations, and then I work with them, and there're some magnificent things coming, and I'm as certain as I stand here that the moment these things are sent into a publisher, not because of what I'm doing, but because of the nature of the thing, that it'll be just snapped up. This is relative, totally fresh new material, no one else has it, they have, through their own channels in the underground, they are being fed this. And so I find it very exciting, and as I said to someone today, I have to sort of take it through my own experience, which included...I won't say poverty, that's not the right word, but absolutely no money, not poverty because we could milk the cow and, you know, raise the garden vegetables and shear our sheep and make our own blankets and, you know, we had food, clothing, and shelter. And then the war in Europe, and I was in well, concentration camps, I wasn't in them, but I was, at Nordhausen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7033], I sort of participated in the burial of five thousand people in one day in open trenches, and was with a headquarters unit a few days after and captured Buchenwald [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152802], and it...I won't say it's these things that pulled together, I was in Weimar [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3955] when it was turned over to the Russians, I remember going out of there, you know, it was half the German population in their carts going toward Eisenach [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7070], to the west, and the Russian cavalry coming in, meeting it from the east...lots of things, but so that's simply what this material comes through, and so I have some sympathy for it. This is a poem ""Drowning"", by a person named Sergei Chudakov [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4517600].

For instance, the original translation was that this whole thing is ""one hour by foot FROM the nearest bus stop"" And as far as I'm concerned, saying ""to"" is apt, a crucial difference, ""and the crooked faces of the plywood"", see, ""are one hour by foot TO the nearest bus stop"". Wanted the whole sense that they might all get up and walk and haunt us, see, coming the other way. Here's a poem about conditions by Artyemy Mikhailov. These names may be just be relatively anonymous, although some of them are among the friends that have been defending Sinyavsky [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q468267] and Daniel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q435770]. His idea about conditions. And it was a pretty rigid, stiff poem and I had to try to get movement in it and so forth. And it's whole, if, if you've, if your dearest friend has not been trapped and dragged to a camp, if, if, if, the entire way through.

Here's one, ""Keeping up with the Humanskys"". It's a poem about keeping up with the Joneses. [Audience laughter]. I had a lieutenant in the army who said his name was Humansky, and he said his, that man, I'll never forget it because he said that means ""son of the fields"" but I've been called worse names. I remember him saying that [audience laughter]. And so I...Son of the fields, I thought, that's great, you know, I was looking for a Russian name that would be like the Joneses, only this is like the serfs, son of the fields, of the soil. Couldn't be better. ""Keeping up with the Humanskys"". So, see, that's my good luck out of a little piece of experience that came to me when I needed it.

There's no title in the original, there's a footnote, which was, these were sent to Axel and Ticosz from Russia, this poem. Neither the name nor the fate of its author is known. The phrase ""Marching in Etape"" originates from the nineteenth century. One stretch of the Long March from Russia to Siberia was called Etape, and it was in a ballad stanza form, so that's the way I did it. It's...little old style, but.

This next one is called """"A Hiroshima Lullaby"""". There's an infinitely sad story. In Hiroshima [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34664] when the bomb fell, in 1945, there was a little girl, Sadako Sasaki [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231997], two years old, some of you may know of her. She was a mile and a half from the centre of the blast and apparently unharmed. She was a very gay and popular girl, and her classmates loved her. And she was in the sixth grade or the equivalent, age twelve, in Hiroshima, Hiroshima, however you pronounce it.  And she developed leukemia, which is of course, as many of you know, a latent effect of many people exposed to radiation, so she was, after all, a victim. And she, well she finally became so ill she had to go to the hospital. And her friends came to visit her. And among other things, they told her, and that she knew, that there's an old Japanese legend about herons. I've been writing poem about herons and cranes and I have some in my book, one on a sandhill crane, and I told some people today that I'm going to the University of Oregon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q766145] in June to speak in their summer Academy of the Arts, and I heard of a person who works in wildlife out in Oregon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q824], and so because of the poem about the crane he's invited me to visit his wildlife refuge, about two or three hours east of Eugene [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q171224], where he has a refuge among other things for sandhill cranes, you know these water birds are simple. And so I'm going to visit him. I look forward to it. Not because of a poem, see, it's nice. And so, Sadako Sasaki in the hospital, she heard that if you fold a thousand paper cranes in this Japanese folding technique, this will protect your health and save you. So she started folding them. And the tale has two sides. She reached 964 and she died. Her classmates were so, at the centre so involved they completed the thousand, they formed them in a chain. They went around gathering the equivalent of pennies, around Japan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17], and when they got enough they asked a sculptor from Tokyo [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1490] to make a statue of this girl, and so he made a statue showing...you'll surely see pictures of this if you haven't. It's a young, twelve year-old girl, you know, still with a girl's body, she's standing up like this....and she stands in the Peace Park in Hiroshima now. And over her, made out of gold, the folded crane. And so, I wanted to write a poem for her. And so just using the fifth in the bass, and then using the five notes, black keys, I wrote a little ballad and I'll probably sing one stanza maybe, and then read the rest.

Well, there are a lot more of these songs and I'm just going to stop the tape at this time because...I haven't even begun reading you my favourite poems, [audience laughter], and I know it's about to end but maybe, maybe I can read for fifteen minutes or so. If you have to go, just get up and go. But. When I was in Italy in 1954, I read in Marcus Cunliffe's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6758114] The Literature of the United States, """"New York is the intellectual centre of the United States.""""  That made my blood boil [audience laughter] because it's a marketplace, so I just simply took his own book, The Literature of the United States, took all his authors, and lined them up, and all the places where they were born, where they grew up, and where they wrote from, and sent them the chart, which proves, out of his own book, that in literature, creative ideas, there have been three great centres and then two subordinate ones. New England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18389], the Midwest, and the South, and then as subordinate ones, they're the West Coast, and then the mid-Atlantic, New York area. That's in literature [audience laughter]. And we got in an argument...the result of it all was that I invited him to come and teach at my university [audience laughter]. So he came and he gave an address, and in one of his speeches he said, """"Americans are overly given to haruspication and scrying"""" [audience laughter]. Well, you know, when someone comes out of England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21] and says, gives, delivers a lecture to an American audience and says that, among other things you have to look up the words. [Audience laughter]. And, so...so I looked them up and I discovered """"haruspication"""", the Haruspects were Roman and Etruscan pagan priests who examined the entrails of sacrificial animals [audience laughter] to predict natural phenomena and the future. So I started thinking about that. I grew up on a general farm, we had about a hundred pigs, two hundred sheep, a hundred head of cattle, twenty milk cows, a thousand chickens, about one hundred turkeys, twelve goats, you know [audience laughter], anywhere from twenty to fifty cats, and all sorts of wild animals, and I had seen bulls gored to death, I had seen flocks of sheep driven over limestone cliffs by dogs, I'd seen hawks that'd ripped little lambs and chickens, I'd seen skunks that had eaten them up, I'd butchered all of these things, I'd castrated, you know, I myself have castrated maybe three thousand pigs, and [laughter]..and...so, I thought okay. In fact, some of you may know that """"The Wheel of Summer"""", the title poem, is about the castration of one hundred pigs, by three teenage boys [audience laughter], and as I was introduced in England once, he said it's probably the most distinguished poem in English about the castration of a hundred pigs. [Audience laughter]. But I started thinking about all of this and I thought, well, okay, I have a philosophy of life too, and it's been based with the whole business of producing food for you. You know, that's the end of it, the end of it all. And I participated in an awful lot of killing and...routine, it’s a way of life. And you know, if you eat meat, well you too. So I said, well okay, I've been haruspicating for a long time. And I gradually went up from age six to age eighteen, and meantime I achieved some kind of maturity, and I'm going to write my own poems. So I wrote all these poems, and the titles are, you know, like ""Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout"", ""Sacrifice of My Pet Lamb"", but I'm going to read you the ultimate titles, which aren't in the book. Just running from age six on up to age eighteen, or when we got all old enough and we all went off to the war, as the last poem said.  But these say, you know, that's what these poems are really about.  

Joseph Langland
01:22:38
""The Clarity of Innocence: Sacrifice of a Trout"". “The Loss of Early Innocence: Sacrifice of My Pet Lamb"". ""The Plunder of Idealism: Sacrifice of the Golden Owl"". ""The Sickle among the Flowers""...I quit making the equation...""The Sickle Among the Flowers"". ""The Decline of Heroic Voices""--that's the goring to death of a bull. ""The Suffocations of Love""--that's the killing a pet chick by over-affection. ""The Attritions of Man"". ""The Unhousing of Beneficent God"". ""The Seeming, the Necessary and Beneficial Perversions of Love""--that's my sacrifice of a gunny sack of cats. ""The Subtleties of Violent Revenge: Sacrifice of an old Sow"". ""The Sweet Solace of Evil"". ""The Absurdities of Fact"". ""The Pitfalls of Group Action: Sacrifice of a Flock of Sheep""--they ran over this cliff, twelve of them died at once, and people say you shouldn't write villanelles, but that's the way sheep act, so I wrote a villanelle, you know, they repeat. ""The Catechism of Human Culpability""--that's Eric, a suicide of a man. ""The Oddities of Affection"". ""The Sacred Violence of Purity"". ""The Bounties of Natural Law"". ""The Winter of the Cold War: Sacrifice of a Grey Wolf"". ""The Decline of Natural Instincts: Sacrifice of Three Wild Geese"". ""The Tyranny of Fixed Ideas""--that's a sacrifice of a red squirrel. ""A Dream of the Ultimate Holocaust: Sacrifice of a Hill of Ants"" and ""The Warfare of the Sensuous Past: Sacrifice of My Aunt Marie"".  And then it all culminates in the longer narrative poem, ""The Wheel of Summer"". Which is just simply coming to maturity as a man. Well I'll, I'll read a few of these. ""Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout"" has no music, but I oftentimes start singing when I'm reading it, but I'm not going to now, I've done that.

""Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats"". I read it in New York City, I didn't know that the officers of the Society for the Friends of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were sitting in the audience. After I went back to Amherst I got a letter from them, saying that every year there are twenty-five million unwanted pets born in the United States [audience laughter] and we secure funds to get the females spayed and the males castrated, and your poem, ""The Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats"" is perfect for our purposes for our annual appeal, and, could we...[audience laughter.]..could we use it, please. I thought, my God, you know, I just, I read this poem, like all of these things out of a great affection, and this is the thing, you'll have to forgive me but this is what occurred to me, you know. I just had this great affectionate conception of the whole thing, and now they wanted to turn it into a kind of contraceptive. [Audience laughter]. And...and then I thought, well, okay, what can I do at this point? And so, showing this charming little picture, you know, it's a dog, and a little puppy dog [audience laughter], little kitten and laying their heads against each other and saying ""Annual Appeal"" and on the back of it was my ""Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats"" and...I, you know, when I travel around the United States even now, I often like wonder in what town did I do in this poor little male cat or this female, you know, cooperating in one way or another, it's like, you know, I have to refuse to pay your taxes...you don't know what you're maiming at a certain point. But that's an example. I wanted to start from the most ordinary thing and see how I could carry it, and this is the ""Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats"".

I asked, what's the other half, they're yellow, orange, and blue, and his home at Libertyville [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1787181], Illinois, you can't improve on that for the title, ""Libertyville"", it has a river the Des Plaines River [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8637], that's before it enters the Chicago [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1297] drainage system, it's a nice blue stream out of the Wisconsin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1537] woods, that's blue, the sky is blue, the light by day is orange, and by night yellow.

The Beard is a poem of mine in the form of a play that's just been arrested fifteen nights in a row by Los Angeles [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q65] police and a state law has been passed against it being performed in the state colleges in California [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99]. These are the trials and tribulations. And right now we're waiting for a panel of three federal judges to come and see it and decide if it has redeeming special significance. [Audience laughter]. And if they don't think it is, we'll take it to the Supreme Court [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11201] and see what they think. And, the play has two characters in it, Billy the Kid [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44200] and Jean Harlow [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105719]. And they're together in a blue velvet eternity, they both are wearing little beards made out of torn white tissue paper. They're--they only thing on the set with them is a table and two chairs covered with furs and Harlow is wearing a blue gown and she has a purse with her and a mirror and the Kid is dressed in a costume appropriate to his costume--I mean appropriate to his career. And when the curtain opens, there's an orange light shining on him which goes up after the first, about the first thirty seconds. And being that this is a poem in the form of a play, I can only read it, I can't read it properly, I can't be two people, I can't be Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow I can only be the author so I'll have to read it that way where it's actually meant to be a poem and acted by me on a stage, on a shelf with lights. We have a shelf with lights, but that's the best I can do.

Um, I'm going to read two more tonight. I want to read for a while and then have an intermission and then I'd like to come back on and play some musical pieces that my music guru George Montana has been working on with me and we've been writing some songs together, but I'd like to read poems for maybe half an hour or so first. I want to read some poems called ""Mad Sonnets"" and I imagine a lot of you know what sons are, what known as sons are, fourteen lines with a legitimate rhyme scheme, and these are not quite exactly like that...Does this microphone sound right? If I stand right here is that okay so that I don't have to lean into it?

I never thought of those signs--they told me I can't smoke up here. It's my life. I'll do what I want, [unintelligible]. [Audience laughter]. The work--I think-are we all, I think I'm waiting for, this technology with which we live in, which is wonderful enough in it's own way, is also costly and [unintelligible], eating up the planet, and I think I'm waiting for an all-chemical science, by means in which we can manifest ourselves through the universe and I guess we'll have to tinker toys like rocket ships and space ships to begin it, but I don't think that's how we'll really do it. And it's become kind of tradition to write songs to science, so I guess I had to do one too.

I've got a book of poems in a language I call Beast Language, they're about half in English and half in this invented language. The book is called Ghost Tantras, ghost like the German word ""gist"", g-i-s-t, which means spirit, and I just said ""ghost"". Why can't ghost be a spirit, why can't we use that in English? And tantra, t-a-n-t-r-a, which is a Hindu form of poetry, it's poetry written in an invented language for magical purposes to bring about changes in the universe. I felt these poems, I felt these poems coming on, and I felt like I had a ball of silence within myself, within my body and I heard these sounds within that ball of silence, and I wrote them down phonetically, so kind of like Marvel comics [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q173496], you know where it says ""keee"" or ""rash"", k-e-e-e, or r-a-s-h. And I see later that things like this have been done in gnostic Bizantine chants too, which also, is like Marvel comics. ""Ka-pow"". And some of them were written in San Francisco, some of them were written in airplanes, on the way to Mexico [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96]. I was going to Mexico to bring back cultures of [unintelligible] Mexicana, the sacred [salsavie (?)] mushroom which were grown by scientists in Brooklyn [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18419]. And, then upon my return I finished from there. I finished these ""Mad Sonnets"", there are 99 of them and I don't think you've probably heard anything like them before, and I guess all you can do is just relax. I like to start with one that starts with English because it's not so strange, they're about a third English or half English maybe.

You've got a tourist card in the back of the room [(?)] Is everybody relaxed? Cause I'm not. Eddie in [unintelligible] was dismissed recently and I guess this poem had something to do with it. And, the poem is the ending of, it's the sexual ending of a very long poem called ""Dark Brown"" I see nothing wrong in taking any sexual part of the poem from any other part of the poem, and the sexual writing today will be viewed in fifty years or a hundred years much the way we view nature poetry today in the 19th century, because some [unintelligible] classes we kept bringing up the fact that for our [unintelligible] today if you were to look at the atmosphere or the air we breathe, the primary part of our environment is either other human bodies or concrete and we choose human bodies rather than the concrete which seems to be a pretty good choice. I think that given the changes that are going on today, I believe we won't be able to say anything. If we can say anything now. If we can say anything anytime but I mean, I think this will be looked upon as [unintelligible] Nature poetry, Shelley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93343] and Keats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82083]were pulling cockney school in their day, which of course was all there is for Shelley since he was a [unintelligible] and probably some of Keats although it was worse since he was a cockney. [Audience laughter]. They were insulted for their new nature poetries, and this too. I'd like to read some like, preliminary stanzas of that poem, and then read part of the longer section which seems to have to do with the [unintelligible]. In Eddie's defense I'll say that the London Times [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50008] literary supplement found that this is [unintelligible]. The poem is written in independent stanzas, I'd like to think of the stanzas as being independent in the way an organism is, and the totality of the poem in the totality in a way an--the way a primitive--and this is a primitive organism is comprised of [unintelligible] individuals to make up its [unintelligible] of being. The poem is called ""Dark Brown"" and I've just opened it to the page I wanted to. The stanza I wanted to.

The second reading in our third series, I don't feel very happy tonight that the crowd is nice and big, and also that because I don't quite know what's going to happen, although I've heard rumours. We have Lionel Kearns [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6555690] and bpNichol [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4953105], as you know, and they have elected instead of doing a reading by each poet, with an intermission in the middle or anything like that, a manner of joint reading. And I think, in a sense, that makes a lot of sense, because Lionel Kearns is by one of his professions, a linguist, and also one of his main, one of his main themes is the social care of human beings. bpNichol is a radical therapist, and is known especially for his border-blur poems, and it makes a lot of sense, I think, for that reason that they do read together. They read together last night at Carleton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1041737], apparently worked out very well. Lionel is as you probably know is one of the centres of the so-called Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639]Renaissance that took over Canadian poetry in the 1960's, threatened to do that too [laughter]. bp was one of those blessed children from the east, although he had lived in Vancouver before, who kept his ears open. Well, he says he was born there. bp managed to grace the city of Vancouver for a few years and I guess that's where he got the ears open in the first place, but since that time he's been opening all our ears. So seeing as how this reading threatens to last four hours, according to rumours, I think I'll stop now and give the floor to either, and, or bpNichol and Lionel Kearns.

There's things that I try to be absolutely very, very personal [inaudible] thing I ever wrote. I wrote it at Port Dover [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7230589], in, on Lake Erie [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5492]. It's one of those days when I was flaked out on the beach, covered up because I get vicious sunburns and just peel the whole summer, and in the background was playing ""(There’ll Be Bluebirds) Over the white cliffs of Dover"" and “What’s New Pussycat” sort of juxtaposed, there was sprawled over the beach was this weird phrase ""Podunk"" and these two cats were playing football overtop of my head. So anyways I felt very sort of, weird, and wrote the following poem.

Hugo Ball [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q70989] was kind of the daddy of us all, and he was kind of a very fine dadaist who lived in Switzerland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39] during the first World War [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q361] and sort of did the first sound poems. It was very strange, if you read Hugo Ball's diaries, it's rather fascinating because it was more or less, when he gave these sort of his final public reading he got really carried away in the midst of a sound poem an kind of got thrown back into sort of a--how to put this--an earlier space in his mind, anyways he went back and started remembering all sorts of things right back through his life doing this sound poem. As you read the diaries, there's a real feeling he became totally terrified of what was happening to him. Because at that point he then just split and left the whole thing behind. So this is kind of for Hugo Ball. It's called ""Dada Lama"". This poem's gone through so many changes I can't even keep track of it anymore.

His image was that of a boat going across a lake and he looked out and saw the ripple of the water behind it and  then commented on that. But I changed the metaphor.

Which had included St. Reet and St. Ranglehold and St. And and it's kind of too complicated to go into what they all sort of were doing, but St. Ranglehold came from the word 'stranglehold' and the rest you can kind of figure out maybe.

This, I'm going to read a concrete poem now. bp inspires me so much with his concrete poetry that I have begun to write concrete poetry too. Some concrete poetry is purely visual and you can't read it, it's to go on walls and things like that. Other concrete poetry is so sonic that it's nothing really to look at, but occasionally you can get the two combined so that you have something on the page which also is something else when read, but the two correspond. This one that I've got is to some extent like that, on the page it's called ""Studies in Interior Decoration Border Design"" because of the way it looks on the page, which of course being an audience at a poetry reading, you aren't concerned with. But I'll read it  and it does work, I think, sonically too. It's called ""The Woman Who Reminded Him of the Woman Who"".

Carne means meat in Spanish. I was at Louis Dudek's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3261787], at one of his courses today and we were talking and the students were talking and so on and I was reading a few poems, and they said, ""Why are you so pessimistic about things?"" and I'm not so pessimistic, and I'll read a poem now that's got an up-beat ending [audience laughter].

I read a poem without an upbeat ending [audience laughter]. This is another media parable. And it's called ""The Parable of the Seventh Seal"" and naturally, it derives from a movie. Um, the movie called The Seven Samurai [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189540]. [Audience laughter.] Or you've probably seen that, there's a,Hollywood [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34006] derived a few movies from that, one of them called The Magnificent Seven [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19069] or something like that. The original one was a Western made in Japan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17], and Hollywood stole the idea and made a Western in the West. Now I've taken the same situation, the same story and given it a Northern locale. And that's why it's called ""The Seventh Seal"" [Audience laughter]. It was published in this New Romans thing, and that makes it an anti-American poem, but it really, when I wrote it, I didn't have this book in mind. But they paid me $30 so [audience laughter] I put it in here.

This is an older poem, it's a Christmas poem, it was written at the time when [Khrushchev (?)] got his call down, also about the time of the American intervention in the Dominican Republic [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q786], where the Americans came in because they knew that there were Cuban influences, or the Cubans were behind the so-called rebels in the Dominican Republic and one of the proofs was that some of the rebels had been seen wearing green uniforms [audience laughter].

A lot of the poems in this book derive their images from dreams, and this is a poem which is about a dream I had. And it's--I've interpreted the dream. Some extent of the poem--I interpreted as a kind of message about where I get my images for my poems, or where I got them at this particular period. And I called ""Ambergris, a Statement on Source"". Ambergris, being that stuff that sick whales cough up and which floats around on the ocean and it's very smelly stuff but it's very valuable stuff if you find it floating around because you can sell it for a great deal of money to perfume factories. And that's the interpretation of the series of images that follow.

This evening, we're having George Oppen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3101810], who is going to start off the third series, now I want to keep this introduction to George very succinct, and I'm going to quote a part of the letter that he sent to us, regarding his activities, I think it adequately, perhaps, sums up what he's been about. It goes like this: ""A bibliography, in so far as my memory will produce it. Objectivist Issue of Poetry, Chicago [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1297], circa 1932. A book, Discrete Series, Objectivist Press, 1934, re-issued by Asphodel Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2089201], 463 The Arcade, Cleveland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37320], Ohio [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1397]. Pound's Active Anthology, 1936, a number of little magazines during 33, 34, Hound and Horn, I believe, Lion and Crown, etc. There it is, you'll see, 25 year gap. Touched on in some of the poems including “Pro Nobis” in This In Which. A forthcoming book, Of Being Numerous, New Directions [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27474] scheduled for the spring of 1968."" And he ends by saying, ""If there is a moral it is one has in fact a great deal of triumph, and then, recently, he has had the following books done: This in Which, by New Directions, 1957, The Materials, New Directions again, 1962, Of Being Numerous, 1968. Now if there's any a book of poems, Discrete Series, there is a long preface by Ezra Pound [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q163366], I'd like to quote a segment of that, which goes like this: ""I salute a serious craftsman, a sensibility which is not every man's sensibility, and which is not been got out of other man's books."" Ladies and gentlemen, George Oppen.

Applause. 

Muriel Rukeyser
00:00:49
Thank you. It sounds peculiar when it's said that way, you know. It just means that I've been writing poems all along, and that sometimes there's been some prose or something film, prose, whatever it is, that spills into the poems that feeds into the poems. And they lie all the time about the poems to us, you know, about all of our poems they say it's something very odd and rare, that people who do it are very odd, if a man does it, he's sexually questionable, if a woman does it she's sexually questionable, besides, very few people do it [audience laughter]. And it's all lies, you know. There's a company in the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] that's made a fortune, on the premise that everybody takes a snapshot at some time or other, and I would like to ask you, and this is apart from all critical standards, all criteria, all faculty and institutions, apart from any of that. I would like to ask a question, how many of you here has ever written a poem, would you put up your hands please? [Audience laughter]. Thank you. I'm always nervous before I ask the question, I ask the question now in all rooms, no matter how few or many people there are and if the universities would generally look around to see if the basketball team is there, but there's always the moment of silence, and looking around first, and generally, quite slowly, almost all the hands go up, maybe four or five do not put up their hands and if I wait around afterwards, and with any luck and favorable wins, the four or five people come up to me and will say something like, I was 15, it was a love poem, it stank. [Audience laughter]. But the thing is it's a human activity. We all do it. We lie about it, you know, and they lie about it to us. And thanks now to the young, the poets maybe, a few other people one could name together, maybe we don't lie so much as we used to, maybe we don't lie about this anymore. Maybe we don't lie about sex, maybe we don't lie about poetry, they seem to lie a great deal about politics instead, it seems to shift around. There are these, and the fact is, we all write poems, it is something we do, we come to this part of experience, as you get a very rainy, rainy evening, why do people come and listen to poems? Or you've got some marvelous summer night, why do people come and listen to poems? Alright, it's partly out of curiosity and looking at the person and I go to see what is that breathing behind, what is that heartbeat, the breathing goes against the heartbeat and these rhythms are set up, and the involuntary muscles and you see the person do it but beyond that, something is what we call shared, something is arrived at, we come to something with almost unmediated, that is the poem among us, between us, there, we're reaching each other, you giving me whatever silence you are giving me and it comes to me with great strength, your silence. Somebody said prima donna, you know, or I'm going to give this to the audience and the conductor says that's what you think, you're going to get it from the audience. That's where it comes from in a funny way. So this mediation, it is not a description, it is not only the music and it, although certainly the reinforcement of sound. The sound climbing up and finally reaching a place, the last word, the sound that begins with the first breathing, the breath of the title. Keats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82083] doing Ode to a Nightingale [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3349126], we hardly ever say ode, nobody says nightingale, but Keats having said that, never has to say it again, it's a bird. You find it in these things, but from the beginning, from the first moment, that is the first breath, the thing that is made as, suggestion, breath, what my life has been, whatever that--what your lives have been. This is a very short one called ""Song"".

This is called ""The Poem As Mask"". It's for another poem, a big Orpheus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q174353] poem that I wrote a long time ago and it had the acting out the women on the mountain after the murder, the pieces of the man scattered about the top of the mountain. The slow coming together of the pieces as God. And I realized, long after, when I came to this newest book, Speed of Darkness, that this was a mask that I did not want anymore of this. You know how it is--it happens to undergraduates, say, it happens to the thing that was just before, and you see these girls acting very childish, and trading on it, and thinking they're still thirteen and able to influence their father, and it's been used up, used up, it served its purpose back there, but it isn't that anymore. And these, phases of being, ""The Poem As Mask"" for Orpheus.

I thought of that very much at the beginning of this month in Mexico [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96], and yesterday when I heard a story. It's a story of what happened at Christmas time, I was in Mexico, I wonder whether you saw it, I heard of it yesterday in New York, as a little, three line story, in the back page of the New York Times [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9684], saying that the largest underground bomb test was about to be held in Nevada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1227] in the States, and to that test, the day before, came five scientists, in Utah [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q829], in the States, to protest, to picket, to try to stop it. And another person who protested, was Howard Hughes [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189081], who owns most of Las Vegas [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23768] at this point, and had his own reasons for protesting. These protests did not stop the testing. The test was made. It was the largest underground made yet. Do you know this story? There was a crack, a crack in the earth, big enough, they said, the way we talk, big enough that the Empire State Building [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9188]. There's a crack there, and deep under the crust there's a three foot crack of some kind, and the rocks are still falling, and they say there will be earthquakes in various parts, unpredictable parts of the world as a result of the shift of the under-crust. Now, last night, before I came here, on TV, late news in New York, they said that there'd been a quake in the Fiji Islands [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24570183]. I have no idea what the relations between these things are, I give it to you simply, that something has happened to shift the under-crust there will be unpredictable results. This is under the ground, the way we are bound to each other, we are all so bound to each other through the air and the fall out has come over Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16], this is also a part of the story that I heard yesterday, and you, I can see by your nods, you know this part of the story. People were saying one thing, and then the other about why don't we do this, why don't they do that, part of the story is that maybe nothing will fall because the Russians also wish to make underground tests. It's part of the ways in which we are bound to each other. I'll give you that. In Mexico, we are bound, under the ground, over the ground, in every way there is. In Mexico, though the stories of what really happened to the students in October, and the stories of people--of many students were killed and the police were among the crowd, and the police wore one white glove or tied a handkerchief around their right hand, and when the helicopters came over, these white hands were put up that said ""don't shoot us, we're police"". Many students were shot and they say in Mexico City [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1489] that the bodies were incinerated and no reports were made and no count was made, and these are the ways in which we are bound too. And yes, I have been translating Octavio Paz, and Ekelof is another such poet, but Paz, the end of one of Octavio's poems, was printed on this issue of the University Students' Journal of the University of Mexico, with the account of September, October, November, December. And the poem ends like this in English, it's not as good, I warn you, these translations are a folly on a madness on a stupidity and at the same time one has to do it, as work to which one is driven, out of love and gratitude, and also out a motive not so noble as any of that, during the times in which one cannot write poems, it is wonderful to have something one cares about out in front of one, and work with it that way, and it's the thing, not spinning out of oneself, in those times, but having something out in front. This is the end of the, of a great poem of Octavio Paz's called ""A Broken Jar"", and jar, of course, water jar, is something quite different in Mexico, we say 'jar', 'jug', something like that, it isn't in the thing we use every day, in Mexico, it's every day, it's that kind of broken jar.

This is a poem, I found a long time ago, you probably have found it in the same way, it's on the back of a one of the Gauguin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37693] watercolours, it's a piece of poem without any heading, without any signature, I didn't know what it was, and it stopped me, and it stayed in me, and I tried to turn it into English, and I couldn't do it. And I finally found out what it was and I finally turned it into English, it's a poem by Charles Morice [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2959857], who is hardly read, now, you know him? No, he's one of those people around Gauguin, and I said well, you can't print anything like that, people, and then 2001 [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q835341] was written and released, and 2001 has stargate, starbaby, the whole thing, and I put the name ""Next"" on this and I'm reading it to you partly for itself, but partly because one line of it is something I used in a poem I wrote when the same thing happened to many of us, the Olympics [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5389] committee wrote to us and asked for poems, you know, for the games, or for the times of the games, or for something. And one wasn't exactly going to do that, but there was something that could be said, and so on. Anyway, this is the Morice, and I've called it ""Next"".

Ladies and gentleman, the poems I'm going to read stretch over a period, it seems hard to believe, of about 45 years, and the writing of poetry has changed quite as much in that time as the world has changed, and probably for the same reason. Some of the poems I start with, you are actually going to hear a rhyme, and they're going to be structured. And you won't appreciate it, but some are going to vary the rhyme form in a way which, when they were written, seemed really quite daring. And I have witnessed, and as poets go on, it will always happen, this continuous evolution of the method--the method of expression and the forms of expression, that the poet, like any other artist, uses. I'm going to start at the beginning of my writing, I was born in Quebec City [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2145], grew up there. The Laurentian mountains [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q75596] are ten miles away, my father was a great lover of nature, we went into the country for picnics all the time, he used to put me at the edge of the mountains and say ""Frank, look North, there's nothing between you and the North Pole"". And after I'd been three and a half years at Oxford [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34433] and in Europe [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46], soaking up nothing up but human history, the background and fundamentals of our civilization, I came back to Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340], which seemed an incredibly ugly, empty, valueless city. The one thing that matched the power of the European tradition was this North land. It's emptiness, it's waiting. So I remember poems touching upon that feeling, and I will read first, this poem is really 45 years old, ""New Names"".

And all I did was to collect these various statements from a number of rooms and put them together to make a single poem, and it goes like this, I call it ""The Indians Speak at Expo 67"".

In one of those rooms, there was a treaty between the British Crown and some Indian Chiefs. These treaties all had one purpose: they were to transfer valuable lands to Indians to the white man. And the treaties I may say always succeeded. This treaty was written out in a very formal manuscript, and the Indians had got hold of the original parchment, or whatever it was on, and they had blown it up to a great big thing they had up on the wall. The treaty was signed by two chiefs, signed--that is to say--the chiefs could not sign their names and presumably could not read the treaty, but they made little drawings, marks, to indicate that they had approved, and this what part of the treaty contains. There was a signature at the top, Chief Ningaram and at the bottom, Chief Wobumingwam.

And I just came across the other day, in a book that I picked up, another thing I think I could call a 'found poem', also by the Indians, it's in The Life of McGillivray, the great fur trader of Montreal and his North West Company [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1142049], you know in the early part of the last century, around 1810-20. This is an account of the North West Company, describing how they relate themselves to the Indians, and you will see the philanthropy.

...start with the poesy, I've been asked to announce that on Friday, i.e., what's this the seventh? Two weeks from tonight, March the 21st at 9 o’clock. in Room 653, [Barnes (?)] willing, there will be a program, I guess within the auspices of the Fine Arts department, the Ira Cohen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1097790], New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] film maker, and poet will be showing three of his films, as far as I know for the first time in Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340]. That's two weeks tonight at 9 in 653. When I was asked to introduce Eli Mandel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3050883], and D.G. Jones [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5203595], I said, 'that's ridiculous', Canadian poetry being the way it is, they already know each other. And after the moment of hilarity I was brought to my senses, and I began to think that it really did make a lot of sense that we do have Doug Jones and Eli Mandel reading on the same program. I can remember in 1961 when Poetry 62 came out, Canadian poetry being the way it is [audience laughter], Poetry 62 was edited by Jean-Guy Pilon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3166089] I believe and Eli Mandel, being a bilingual book, and at the time the poem that struck me as the most interesting was the long poem by D.G. Jones, the most interesting in that anthology, and I therefore, felt kind of warm, without having them, to both of them to Doug's poem and Eli's great taste for putting it in the anthology. And then I thought that there was this kind of confluence going on and I began to see all kinds of other things happening too, for instance, they both had their first books published by Contact Press, that published the first books of most of the important Canadian poets, and they now have seen their careers sort of criss-cross one another in a kind of a funny way because they each have three books, except that Eli has three and a third, which is also kind of Canadian, and I thought it was kind of interesting because not only is there a kind of parallel going on, and they both in 1967, for instance, turned out very good books of poetry, but there's a kind of uh, they'll be kind of an interesting contrast I think in tonight's program because I've always considered that Doug Jones is sort of the best of the Ontario [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904] Wasp poets [audience laughter], and Eli Mandel is the best of the Western Jewish poets and they both deal with essential problems that seem to expose their two opposing and therefore contrary and conjugal, you might almost say, attitudes towards the business of writing poems. So we're going to start off with Eli's reading, and then have something like a ten minute break, and then we'll have Doug Jones' reading. I should mention that of those two books, Eli's is called An Idiot Joy and it shared the Governor General's Award [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q283256] given in 1968, and published by Hurtig, Edmonton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2096] publisher, who is very pleased to get the Governor General's Award, and Doug Jones' book is Phrases from Orpheus, published by Oxford Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217595], two books that would be well worth investing both your heaven, forbid, money and your imagination upon. I'm probably not going to say anything before D.G. Jones comes to read, so I'm not expecting to come up here and spout for five or ten minutes before he reads and I'm not going to spout any longer before Eli reads. So I'd first like to introduce to you Mr. Eli Mandel.

I think George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280] might have carried the parallel of contrasts and comparisons a little further had he wanted to, or chosen to, or had he known about certain very intimate details about Doug's life and my life. But I don't propose to go into those myself right now either [audience laughter]. Instead, I'm going to read, primarily from An Idiot Joy, but also from Black and Secret Man, which was an earlier book and also from one or two manuscript poems that I've been working on recently. I want to start with a poem called ""Signatures"" and although I can say a lot about a number of poems that I've written, I'm not sure I can say much about this except that as will be obvious to you I think, the imagery is drawn from the Vietnam [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q881] conflict, though I don't know that the poem is necessarily about that. Can you hear me with this mic? Some people at the back are saying 'no'. Can you hear me now?

This is a poem from Black and Secret Man and it's called ""The Direction is North Until the Pole"", and I suppose it's one of the few poems I've written that I would call a Canadian poem, that is to say it draws on a number of specific images from the Canadian landscape and therefore I have to annotate this poem. I have to tell you that the Fleming mentioned in the last line of the poem was once a Minister of Finance in the federal government, that just proves how transient political poems really are. I think all the rest of this should be clear, hockey is a game that's played in Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16].

This is one of my prophetic poems. I think I've written a lot of really prophetic poems. This poem is called ""Departure"" and it tells about leaving Edmonton. Everybody who has read the poem believes that I wrote it when I decided to leave Edmonton, either for the first time or the second time, I've left there twice, as a matter of fact, I didn't write it when I decided to leave in Edmonton, I wrote it when I arrived in Edmonton.

A little poem about one of my perversions, this is about making love to pregnant women, I think, I'm not sure if there's a technical name for that but the perversion appears in the poem. The poem's called ""Cassandra"" and it's about a prophetess, Cassandra [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779], you'll remember was the woman that Agamemnon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128176]  brought home with him to his wife, Clytemnestra [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131157], and this, so angered Clytemnestra, aside from the fact that Agamemnon had killed one of their daughters, that she killed Agamemnon, but Cassandra was a Prophetess, like Prophetesses, was given the power to tell the truth and was never believed. Some of the imagery in this poem is taken from the story of Cassandra, and the rest from my perversions.

This poem is called ""Manner of Suicide"", and it's the closest thing I've come to writing a found poem, in that all the material in the poem, the words are taken from two sources, except for the first line. One is Karl Menninger's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3080926] Man Against Himself and the other, the Jewish Daily Prayer Book. There are twenty-six ways listed here of committing suicide, they're all ways that Menninger lists and documents, and he lists them in the order in which I give them here, and this list, which I give, is then followed by some comments he makes about those ways of committing suicide and a passage from the prayer book.

In An Idiot Joy I wrote a number of poems which were, which used two primary images, the image of the moon and the image of the sea, and these are love poems. I suppose the interesting thing in them to me, aside from the personal sense that I feel about them, is that with each of the poems, whether it's with the image of the moon or the image of the sea, or both, I keep trying different technical things in the poetry, and so far as I'm concerned, I've done some more interesting technical things in this than anywhere else, but primarily, the poems talk about the moon and the sea, and seabirds and women and a woman.

This is my letter, to be opened later.

I'm going to read a lyric, it's a very short poem, but I'd like to read this one anyhow. It's called ""To My Children"" and it's based upon both an odd and rather terrifying coincidence in my life and a curious Jewish tradition. The Jewish tradition is that you name a child after the nearest dead relative, the relative who has died most recently and who is closest to one, and it so happened that my mother died, my daughter was born, my father died and my son was born. And I wrote this poem about the naming of the children. It's called ""To My Children"".

Now I'm going to finish this reading with two poems, one is called ""The Meaning of the I Ching"" and the other ""Cosmos: the Giant Rose""--three poems, I'm sorry. I'm going to read ""Pictures in an Institution"" as well. ""The Meaning of the I Ching"", the I Ching [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q181937] as you probably know is a book of divination, it's the oldest book of divination known, and when I first heard about it, I looked at the book before I opened it and I wondered about the very simple notion of a book that old telling my future. How could I be contained in this ancient book? And I wrote this poem. Now it seems to me that there is something remarkable here, it's one claim I will make for the poem, at least, in the poem, is the first time I used the phrase ""earth upon earth"" and the very first hexagram that I cast when I opened the book. The book tells fortunes with what are called hexagrams and hexagrams are given various names, the very first one that I cast was the hexagram ""earth upon earth"" and that's simply something that happened whether it means that the poem is prophetic or magical, I don't know.

Accused me of being one of the people who didn't have any troubles in life, or not only me but somebody else too, when we had quite a few of our own that were not too dissimilar from those that the other person was talking about. It's about marriage. It's called, to avoid looking too obvious, ""De Profundis Conjugii Vox et Responsum''. It's a serious poem though, more or less.

This poem is the long poem I referred to, it's a kind of confessional poem, it's only about, I suppose, ten years behind Robert Lowell [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q981448] and the other American poets who have been writing what the critics now call confessional poetry, which is about par, I suppose. This poem was more or less actually complete several years ago, but I got so many things into the poem I wasn't sure how I was going to get out. And I've dickied around with it and possibly added a few more things, and finally I kept what I had in the end anyway, which was simply a way of ducking out I suspect. Though I hope there's some kind of peculiar relationship to the end, and everything else. I haven't been able to find a title for it. ""Night Thoughts"", might do, but somebody used that. But it's something along this line: the situation, the scheme is to present a kind of series of reminiscences, mediations, memories which disintegrate and become a little more peculiar as time goes on. Then suddenly stops, breaks off with morning. And it's set more or less around my cottage that I had, in Ontario, which wasn't far from where I was born. This is written in sections but I won't bother reading all the numbers, I'll just pause and go on.

It's my pleasure this evening to introduce to you Robin Blaser [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2115003], recently of Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639], and a little bit before that, from San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62] and elsewhere. Can you hear me? Can you all hear me? Okay. Well, I haven't really a great deal to say, I wanted to say simply that I met Robin Blaser in June of 1964, the occasion was the usual round of parties and a rather un-memorable reading, and a marvelous day out into the countryside, and I also had on that occasion the pleasure of meeting two very close friends of his, Stan Persky [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2330087] and Jack Spicer [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3805658]. I'll read you this little sort of resume of his career. He was born in Idaho [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1221], and he studied at Northwestern [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309350] and Berkeley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q168756], and was a librarian at Harvard [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13371] from 1955 to '59. He now teaches in exile at Simon Fraser University [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201603], has made an important contribution to the San Francisco poetry renaissance in the '50's and the '60's, and was one of a triumvirate, with Duncan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q964391] and Spicer, that fulminated the serial poem on the poetry scene. Among his own serial poems are “The Faerie Queene” and “Image-Nation”. His verse has been published in a number of contemporary poetry anthologies. They include, among many, Donald Allen's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5293963] The New American Poetry [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7753501], the Penguin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3374730] New Writing in the United States, and A Controversy of Poets. And among his volumes of poetry are The Boston Poems 1956-58, The Moth Poem, Les Chimeres, and Cups. He is the editor of a West Coast magazine called the Pacific Nation. Now, Robin? Please read for us.

The marvelous thing about that list of books is that The Boston Poems, in fact, I think I will read one of those, was published and I decided I didn't like the book so there's one copy in the world and I own that copy. So I'm not sure it's fair, to call that a book. I don't think I--but I think I will read, open with that, it now dates back so many years, back to the Boston [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100] world, when [Jack] Spicer, and [John] Wieners [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1702153] and I were there together, and a very different scene from anything. [Charles] Olson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q922978] was at Black Mountain [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2413277], and Wieners in the centre at Boston. This poem is ""The Hunger of Sound"", and the date of it would be 1956.

Now I, I'm a little confused because I've changed the reading now because it was very nice to have people ask for things, so I think I'll read ""Cups"", which is a...I've worked since 1960 on a book called The Holy Forest and that is composed of several serial poems, the first of which is ""Cups"", and that is followed by one called ""The Park"", and one called ""The Faerie Queen"", then ""The Moth Poem"", and then the, then there is a group, translated from Gérard de Nerval [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q191305], ""Les Chimeres"", which is also a serial poem, and finally a group called ""The Holy Forest"", an unfinished group, and I thought I would read ""Cups"" and then a section, do a little thing on my poetics, an intermission, and then read, if you still are with me, the section I've just finished, called ""The Holy Forest"". This is ""Cups"".

...say anything about Robert Duncan's credentials, so I'll make this as brief as possible. M.L. Rosenthal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6723336] said, a little while ago in the Reporter that Duncan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57421163] was the best of the poets in the experimental tradition and Warren Tolman says he's the best poet writing in the English Language, and I'd probably go further than that. And it's the reading we've been waiting for\, most of us\, all year, so I'd like to give him as much time as there possibly is. Robert Duncan.

In the early 50's, I belonged to a, not a group, because as a matter of fact we were scattered, some in Europe and some in America and didn't know each other, but we were all reacting to a, we all had response of a feeling of poetic responsibility and also a poetic mission, arising out of our response to the publication of Ezra Pound's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q163366] ""Pisan Cantos"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2701465] and the publication that came year after year of the parts of William Carlos Williams's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106] ""Paterson"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7017378] but in the same period in magazines, some of the poetry of the later William Carlos Williams was appearing. And it does interest me, although the command of the Modernists had been to write in a natural speech, that in response to features that were appearing in Williams more than Pound, because Pound's lines are all syntactic utterances, but in Williams there's a kind of enjambment and there was a juncture appearing at the end of lines. And we, we took that juncture over and imposed it upon the language, but even in imposing it, found that we had arrived at something that's quite common indeed in our English speech, the stutter is at one end of it, but it is one of the forms we have when we are emotionally excited and things are broken up into phrases and words become almost painful and impossible to say, and this encounter we explored for some time. Later, I'm going to be reading, in passages, which will bring into question radically something related to his. My poetry developed along lines that I began to see as allied to the collage, things that were appearing in American painting, that is whole elements and bits would be taken from anywhere, and very early, at the time, as a matter of fact that I was writing The Opening of the Field, I viewed myself as a kind of jackdaw of poetry and gave up entirely worrying about if I had any originality or had a voice of my own. I was much more attracted picking up things and building them into something, so I was a weaver, I felt in some ways, almost before I was a speaker, and I was a weaver of voices and did not care, or- I decided well, I happen to be the one who is doing this, so certainly that's one thing that I don't have to have an effort about. There's nothing else that's going to be moving out from here. In passages, you'll find a new feature about that collage, but it's already contained in the thing I was suggesting that we took over- the juncture, Creeley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q918620] for instance built a whole personal style from that juncture and by making its articulation radical, and forcing it into a depth of an emotional statement, and of course of an intellectual statement, because the whole framework of thought changes. Very striking to us in the very beginning was that form was the content, not, it was very hard to determine it, you could say that it even determined content, there was no cause to effect relationship for us, between form and content. Structure determined the nature of what was to thought, like the structure of a body is to what we are, and we didn't think of them as divided, so we were incarnationists in that sense. I feel very strongly that you'll find that repeatedly a theme of my poetry the incarnation of Christ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302], the incarnation of spirit and the body, that spirit, that the divine world is manifest and incarnate, and that in its- led us back to the poem as the incarnation and place in which- the spirit doesn't enter poetry, incarnate, it exists. But it was also a collage and you will hear Greek and French entering this world of a collage, and it will be as reformed as the American language is when it enters my collage. And reformed to American contours, the contours of French, and the contours of Greek disappear, forced back into an American stress system, which I find analogous. The French poets were extremely disturbed when Stravinsky set them, she could not bear to hear [Persephone (?)] and because they all came out, French all came out to be Russian in its entire tonation and the French not very happy when the French language turns up in an intonation. I'm thinking of the Parisian, but no Frenchman's very happy about the French language turning up, turning out to be American or Russian. Now my poetry doesn't turn out to be exactly American either, it turns out to be strictly forced back to conform to my poetic patterns, and Greek is not intoned but is forced into a stress pattern. However, with Greek I'm in for free because there's no man who can say what you do with it anyway. In America, we have one system, in Germany, they have another system, and in England, they have, still, a third system of what to do with vowels and what to do with the whole thing. And there's a controversy about whether you do have pitch or whether you do have stress and that arises from the fact that the Hellenistic Greeks [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q428995] already couldn't figure out exactly what you did with those Greek choruses, and they had to put those marks in to instruct their readers what to do, and we don't know what those marks meant for sure [audience laughter]. But they certainly didn't know what it had been like 500 years before. They did poorer, I take it, than the poorest, and that would include me, informed of us do with Middle English [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36395], and I guess we're nearer to it than they were. Okay, well, we'll just start out and I want to take a path, I'm going to take a path through beginning with a small group of poems from The Opening of the Field.

When I was about 30, a great Medieval Historian was teaching at the University of California [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184478], where I made my living teaching, typing thesis and term papers when I was really hard out of luck and the rumour was very thick indeed that something extraordinary had happened, I think, and my impression is that Universities kill off scholars today much faster than they- they certainly don't kill off poets, they give them very handsome fees to come for a week or so, but they certainly kill off scholars, but the existence- perhaps only the World War with its refugee professors from Europe brought this kind of scholarship onto the scene at the University of California and I returned to school to take up Medieval Studies. One of the, clearly, in my work I, the one course, and I studied with that man until he left for the Princeton Institute of Advanced Learning, studied for him--with him for two and a half years, the course that most changed my poetry was a course on Medieval law, and the growth of constitutional law, because the very basis of poetry I think is a- of art, is the discovery of laws, the laws that finally we can trace through from those Medieval concepts of law and constant meditations upon law so I'm going to read a couple of more poems of our- in which this concept of law moves. This is ""Structure of Rime XIII"" and it's part of an open construct that is a construct that has nothing in its concept, does not belong to a world of cause or effect. It has a chronology, but its chronology is like our chronological time, that is seen by contemporary physics as an anomaly within a time--within a physical time that cannot possibly have the character of a chronological sequence. The best they can explain is that we must inhabit a thread that is suspended in actual time, because actual physical time cannot really be one directional, and we experience one directional time because we are really caught in some isolated thread, in the medium of time. So in ""Structure of Rime"" I conceive of myself not in a chronology, although I experience it, being human as such, but as entering such a domain in which real law exists and real time exists, and the real form to which the poem refers and from which it derives its form. The real form has no beginning or end, and is much faster, is universal, so the--in writing the poem I do not create a form, but participate in a form which is of the nature that we believe the physical world to be and I am much for a convert of Whitehead's process and reality in which we believe the spiritual world to be. And that's where ""The Structure of Rime"" takes place. When I say 'thirteen',  that's of course, in my own sequence then and I conceive of that sequence as actually existing in a part of the mosaic that does not have the character of sequence.

Some time shortly after The Opening of the Field was published, I was invited up to Portland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6106] by a lawyer and his wife to talk to a small group and I learned in correspondence that he had been attracted to my poetry because of the concepts of law as they move through poems, and so I wrote, for them, the poem called ""The Law"", a series and variation.

When Adams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11806] said, “the which”, meaning, he said, ""Democracy, the which requires the continual exercise of virtue beyond the reach of human infirmity, even in its best estate"" he was writing to Jefferson and talking about something that was absolutely necessary, he did not mean that we could escape from what required what was impossible. We had to live in the impossible, which is where I found myself entirely in concord with certainly a poet understands what it is to live in the impossible. He speaks in the first place in a voice which is impossible for himself to speak in, and before which he must always be a flunk out and in some sense, a political- a poetical failure in relation to what everywhere's own poetics is to point out what is necessary. Let me in relation to the law again, read the opening of a poem that I will be later be reading entire, but I want to bring it in context with these poems and the law, and close it with a John Adams that I discovered only a passage of John Adams that I discovered for myself, only about what, it's two or three years ago, two years ago. ""Reading on Myth"", this was from a book called I think it's called 18th Century Against the Gods, or confronts--The 18th Century Confronts the Gods and the chapter on John Adams's mythology was a fascinating chapter, and this passage of the poem is built up entirely with no interpolations at all of--it's built up to the place where I cease to read it, with no interpolations at all of passages of the marginalia that John Adams writes in an Encyclopedia of Mythology.

Move back to another early poem in The Opening of the Field that was formative to, throughout my work and the last I guess it must be, each one of these is about three, this is the last ten years. The Field began in 1956, so it must be the last 14 years. And this poem is written in 1956. Take my coat off. In articulating the line, we were opening up- Pound had very early said [unintelligible] by the musical phrase and as I said, since his phrases were identical with syntactic utterances, with sentence utterances, the phrase is- the phrase is simpler than the phrases we use, where often they are enjambed, where often they disturb the meaning of the sentence and suspend elements so that they operate in various parts we did not want what was called an ambiguity by Mr. [Adams (?)], we wanted a multi-phasic area of meanings which is something very different. We wanted all parts to operate within all other parts. And I think this is a crucial difference from what let's say fascinated the metaphysicals of the post-Eliot [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37767] period in their idea of ambiguities. We wanted one meaning operating within another meaning and they wanted one meaning secretly giving another meaning, I may have such things too, but I mean it's a very different feeling for us. Certainly they did not have to come to articulate as we did, and with these poems, when I get to, as you'll see in passages, when I get into rhythmic articulations where only my body is intelligent enough to keep them, so I have to throw them back into my hands and to my body, a dance can carry them and a dance is really in a sense, the poem in which I moved straight forward and realized how un-literary this was and not exactly song either, and that this dance centre was going to be for whole sections of poems. So, there's a key poem.

Someone said this evening I probably wouldn't read The Pindar poems, I will. Oh let me sing a song for you, songs, I have a couple of songs that are in books. Songs for me are not that quaint form that, a few of them are like the night nurse's songs, the song the night nurse sang. But a song of the old order and some of the other songs are actual songs, that means when I was writing them, a tune came. And they had only one voice to be in, mine, and we could even say unhappily, but there they were. And startled I was when, this is I think, one of the first songs that came that really belonged in a book of poetry. I had early had some songs in Faust Foutu in a sort of a long play that would never get performed in my mind so I was able to whatever I wanted to in it, and- which is a great kind of play to write, because you don't have to worry about anyone else solving any problems, you can name it, they can be on the moon, or whatever, have no stage dimension problems, but also of course I had no song dimension problems but when I wrote this song, ""Gee, I know I'm going to have to get up and sing it"", well of course now you'll get away with it because how rare you'd hear a poet's voice, unless a poet's already like your happy rock-n-roll singer, which I ain't as you will hear. My idea of song is exceedingly primitive indeed, my impression is very, I think you will hear it in this song, it comes from a brief period in which to much the horror of my theosophical parents, but because we were living in a small town and all your friends went to a Sunday School, I went for several years to a Methodist Sunday school and somebody along the line gave me the hint that hymns would come out much better if I just moved my mouth and didn't join in, happily, the lovely music that was going on and so of course I always wanted to write a hymn and there's something in the Methodist hymnal for sure in the song I'm going to sing. ""A Song of the Old Order"". It's not strictly Methodist in theology, but I meant that it's something of the Methodist hymn. However, I will sing also, by following another song that is certainly Calvinist [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101849], it's a Halloween song, and like only the scotch can possibly dig out of there- the Calvinist counter hymnal.

That was considerably higher than I've ever tried to do it before. [Audience laughter]. But, like a poem, when you're writing it, when you're in it, you're in for it. You can't re-model it to something you think you might get through with. So I will now do the Pindar poem. That somewhat determines what long poem we're going to do. And since this is the first time I've read here in Montreal, some other places I read, I try and give them new stuff, but I take it outside of some tapes that might be available, you haven't really heard these poems. And this will be the last one from The Opening of the Field. I'll pick up a couple from Roots and Branches and then I will be reading from the current, the Bending the Bow and then after the break I'll read some of the new poems that I've written since Bending the Bow. [Take off Biney's Law (?).] No, this is not the beginning of a Ginsberg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711] round [laughter.] ""Beginning with a Line by Pindar"", I am ending up with an exhibition by Ginsberg, [laughter.] We've gotten so [unintelligible] in San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62] since all barriers of all kinds were down you really couldn't compete with the show, so you've got, I mean what to do. Common, ordinary people are just left out, you've got to be somebody extraordinary now to [audience laughter], and poetry has to be my extraordinary thing. Believe me, the rest of me is just me.

The other poem I will read from Roots and Branches is ""The Continent"". My poetic thought continuously arises from the ground of my happy and, believe me, wildly misunderstanding readings of contemporary science. And the one real poetic source I have is not a literary magazine but Scientific American [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39379] which I avidly read. So I'm more likely to be studying language than I am to be studying poems and more likely to be studying the world, than I am to be- well, I can't say that, language and the world get even treatment. The poem ""The Continent"" came from the re-assertion that has come in recent years of evidence which has rebuilt the picture of the continental drift. And I was happy at the coordinates to find that Charles Olson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q922978], who also ransacks the same magazine, but does not have the same misunderstandings of the magazine by any means, we have quite a, we sometimes come to [loggerheads (?) ] in our very positively taken misunderstandings of what is. He also had built sections of “Maximus [Poems]” on the continental drift. I love puns of course right away, and so does he, and if you get my drift in poetry, you will see something of what is revealed when we begin to get the drift of those continents and the fittingness of poetry is of course the logic whereby we identify that the continents originally fitted together and identified the sequence of things that happened. They do fit together, but they must have- I mean, the universe- the Neo-plateness, [unintelligible], well no, it isn't a neo-plate, well, it's a near neo-plate, and it's [unintelligible] Judas [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81018] refers to the masterpiece which is the Universe, that's the only masterpiece and the rest of us compose masterpieces because we are children of the universe, although we may not recognize that that's what we are doing. Some of us don't have entire respect for what we belong to. ""The Continent"".

Now the one poem from, poetry I've written since then, a poem called ""Achilles' Song"". One note before I read it, the island that we would ordinarily in American call ‘Leuke’ a [unintelligible], like in Leukemia--leuke. In Greek would be ‘Lay-okay’ and so I was very alarmed indeed when in this poem, as I was writing it came out ‘Loy-kay’ and it took me quite some time of sheer stage fright and horror at the mis-pronunciation recall the ‘Lauke’ in German is the [unintelligible] and so forth in German, and that I have had for years now, for some years now a tape of H.D. [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q236469] reading from her ""Helen in Egypt"", a poem which is really the mother poem of this poem, and not too much hidden in the poem, for those who know of  my closeness to H.D. who was certainly a surrogate mother for me. Thetis of the poem would certainly be the poetess H.D. and in that tape, H.D. who had lived for most of her life from the 20's on in Switzerland, uses the German pronunciation throughout, ‘Aloike’ and that's how I heard it in association with this poem. So I've finally recognized where it came from but it's an example of the fact that you cannot correct things in poems because it's sewn into a rhyme and absolutely belongs in the music here. Play it differently--I mean, it's what fits a poem not what fits some other system outside the poem that the poem must adhere to. Okay, ""Achilles' Song"".

Two aspects of the art, seem particularly mysteries to me as I've been working at the art of poetry since I was 19 and it's now 30 years. In relation to that thing we call rhyme, meter and so forth, I have come to think more and more that it's ratios and numbers that may be the heart of the matter. And at the same time as I begin to feel that at the heart of the matter, as one begins to, as one does with mysteries, be fearful about approaching the question. Some years ago, two years ago or so, with the poet Zukofsky [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q975481], who knows much more than I do of the art, and performs really awesomely in it, I said it had begun, I said ""Zuk,” I said, “I had begun to feel that it isn't a question about syllables or stresses and so forth, it's a question of numbers"". And he said ""Yes, I've decided by now I ought to, certainly if I don't know syllables and stresses and so forth, by now, I mean know them only in my hand, I certainly shouldn't be thinking about them. And I am now only dealing with 8's. All of these lines are 8's, straight through. I have not yet really phased the initiations of the question of numbers but I know that this is central as one moves into the period of working in the art that I'm in."" The other thing, and that is that I have indicated it earlier, is that the nature of the time of the art is increasingly mysterious, the one thing I'm sure of it cannot be, positive absolutely defined in one area, for a long time I was doing happily enough with the formula that Christians made for themselves of time and eternity and their term of eternity which is the very present moment of any work of art and is also of course somehow containing the ensemble of all of the things created must also be like that time that physics talks about. That makes them puzzle why in the world our own time goes from a thing we call the past to the future. Whitehead [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183372] solves it in Process and Reality by suggesting that we create, in every moment that we live a past and a future, and we live in a history consequently because that's what we create what we are, is pastness and future, and sum it up in a material, that is still persuasive. But a mystery is when none of the answers are answers and as long as they're not answers the artist has them as really, forces that move as art. Now I make this remark because, well I said something about chronologies I, in the past I have not read these two poems as they appear in the book, in readings, but I want to read them today and I'm going to just underline the transition I want you to see and share with me at this point. I arranged, for all that what I've said about chronologies, I arranged the poems in my volumes chronologically and largely because it seems to me a mystery as they go and the rhymes appear from one to the other, and one poem will be an announcement of a succeeding poem or themes will flow out of it. The one I'm going to read first is not a “Passages"" it's called ""Reflections"" and at the close, and as a theme of it, you will find the old man, who is as a matter of fact, I structure rhyme preceding it had a fire master appearing, who seems very close indeed to the master of fire, and the poem that came next, it may have been in a couple of weeks of so, this was a very productive period, concludes with a figure of an old man tuning a drum between a bowl of fire and a bowl of water, and it was followed by a ""Passages"" which is called ""The Fire"", and from it we can learn that the fire that you see in ""Passages"" which is catastrophic, and is held in a polarity with an ideogram with the natural world, that that which may have indeed be--is indeed a bowl of water, as you will see, I mean it's a stream of water that the fire is composed between a world of water and its own world of fire, but that fire that looks like a catastrophe you will find is the creative fire--if you go under ""Reflections"" and let the reflections that came first reflect into the poem following. Now these are things that you realize afterwards, in your own chronology. I am one of those poets who has the characteristic I find in my study of Whitman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81438] in the last three years that Whitman certainly was another poet who studied himself all the time. We have a great prohibition in our contemporary world against studying yourself, but I am not short on the world of ego, so I'm not really very disturbed about the fact that I study myself in the poetry. But the one thing I search to find is not something we would ordinarily call ourselves, I study the poet, the thing that the poems are creating in order for them to come into being. That I can sharply distinguish from myself. As sharply as you can do it, it takes office, the idea of office, and this again I got from my Medieval Studies. Okay, I'm going to read ""Reflections"" and then I'm going to read ""The Fire"" and then I will, the poems I will be reading from then on will be ""Passages"", ""Fire"" is one of ""Passages"". And ""Passages"" is as I explained, an open form that exists in these other universe of time, of something, like, you call eternity.

...beginning with a poem called ""Soldiers"", a poem in which, um, let's see, right, some lines of Victor Hugo [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q535] enter, I decided I should, well, I guess, lets see, no I don't want to read too late, and soldiers is rather long again, so I want- certain themes that are moving in ""Soldiers"" will reappear. In ""Soldiers"", a recurring line was one from a poem of Victor Hugo's, ""Dieu dans [unintelligible] reve"", which is a line really quite in tune with my own poetics, ""God, oh creator the- or the creator for us too in oneself whose dream, whose work goes much further than our dreams"" and so it's combined with a scene that's Vietnam and it's combined in the Soldiers with the theme of the recognition that in some mystery of that work that goes further than our dreams the soldiers in Vietnam most of them, have just there, and they're 19 or 18 and so forth, they have only there in which to make their lives. And they have only there in which to, to take their souls in the war, as the followers of Orpheus take soul in the poem. The wood to take fire from that dirty flame. A recognition that that is their field in which they must reach life's epiphany and its thing. And the line of Victor Hugo carried me forward to and returned me to grand themes of Victor Hugo's but it also took me back to Vietnam [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q881] and I wanted to give, before I read ""The Kao Dai"" a little sketch of that. There's a theme of Victor Hugo, by the way, of the fall of Lucifer [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q185498] in which, Lucifer's falling into his own denial of God and in falling he opens the univ- creation, and but in his falling a feather breaks loose from his wings and is floating mid-air, and the sight of God descending falls upon the feather and it becomes light and it turns into an angel and that angel is Liberty and that angel's entire message is to transform the rage and wrathful light that had fallen upon it into the reunion and resurrection of Satan, but of course both Satan and God must be called from their wrath, to reconciliation, so this angel, Liberty and Freedom is also the angel of reconciliation and Victor Hugo knew that also there must be some explanation for the fact that the desire and yearning for freedom and liberty has always been wrathful. Blake [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513] is puzzled by the same thing and I think that today, when all over the world, not only in Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16], but in the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30], and in China [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29520], and Yugoslavia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36704] and Russia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q159] the wrath of Liberty is rising and it is the wrath of God against the civilization to its very roots which we know in our hearts are Godless. But that wrath must be reconciled, because it is itself that it's rising against and there's some mystery in this, so my poetry has begun to take up the figure of that angel and the angel comes into it. Now, in Vietnam, one of the strongest forces in the Viet Cong, not a communist group but a religious group, the Cao Dai [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q470364] and in order to read more in deeper into the Cao Dai, I wisely, I think, went back to sources to the early thirties before Vietnam was quite the cause it is today, and found this story and it came quite in line with my kooky family and my own poetry because it was at a medium's table in 1925 on Christmas Eve, when Christ descended and speaking in French, as I usually put it when I read my, something worse than American French, a French man would feel that that was blasphemy, but I'm after all repeating Christ's words in his own voice so that might be more serious yet that that voice was being attempted. Christ came into the medium and renounced in my birth day for the spirit is descending upon Vietnam and when we remember what happened to the very first generation of Christians who were burned in rows as torches, what the promise of Christ meant to his immediate blessing, the powers of martyrdom. The promise of Christ in 1925 was amply fulfilled to his new disciples. So amply, as a matter of fact, the Cao Dai had more than come to my mind, because the cathedral town of Cao Dai, which is [unintelligible] indeed exactly like a Catholic nunnery or convent, or a Buddhist nunnery or convent is Communist, is the province of Tay Ninh [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36608], and the Cathedral city of Tay Ninh, now it is been repeated over and over in American papers that when those planes were returning for missions in North Vietnam and hadn't dumped their missions, you're not supposed to return any bombs, you gotta dump them somewhere, so they'd dump them on Tay Ninh, you'd just go over the side and dump them on Tay Ninh, because this particular religious group was stubborn indeed in its inherences. Now, also interesting to me was this particular religious group had as its patron Saint Victor Hugo, and the first place that the French are, that the Vietnamese have French as their deepest religious and literary language and so Christ talked in French so Victor Hugo gave the whole line, it's Victor Hugo's Christ who talked to them at the medium tables in French, and they of course had their medium tables in the line of the tradition of Victor Hugo's own medium tables in the Isle of Jersey. So Victor Hugo becomes patron saint for these passages. In the passage, by the way, a passage called ""Orders"" and I will read a passage from it in which I am actually translating from Victor Hugo quite directly but it's a very long poem and keeping in tune with that master of the sublime is very difficult for us in the modern period. Here we are, the passage, wait a minute, it isn't in that poem, I always think it's in ""Orders"", but it's actually in place of a passage 22, that has the passage with Victor Hugo. I have been working on it for years, and it's mainly trying to keep in tune, I go over and over and over it again and then I find it very difficult to deal with 19th century poetry. But this is a passage straight translation, as literal as I could from Victor Hugo, but really, massive poem.

I'm glad we got this room. Welcome back to the first night of the fourth year of our series. And for those of you who are here for the first time, welcome you too. I'm really glad that we could start off with Jerome Rothenberg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1775056], especially from my own personal viewpoint, because while Jerome Rothenberg is one of the names that I've paid a lot of attention to, and one of the names that poets have paid attention to over the last decade, this'll be the first time that I've been able to hear him read, too. Usually when, often when us people from the West think about the new American poetry, we tend to think of it in terms of people from outposts such as New Mexico [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1522], and Utah, [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q829] and San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62], and so on. And we forget that New York City [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] is one of the centre-place, central-places, so that it can produce poets such as Joel Oppenheimer [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6213806] who will be here in the following spring, and Paul Blackburn [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7149388], who was here a couple of years ago. Jerome Rothenberg has always been the centre, in the centre of that scene, and not only as one of the principal poets, but as editor, and publisher, and so on and so forth, especially with a very important magazine of the 1960's called some--oblique thing [some/thing]. And he's especially interesting to me too because of the kind of work that produced a book such as Technicians of the Sacred, a compilation of the poetries from various oral traditions around the world, and a similar sort of impulse has always been at the centre of his work too. I'd also like to correct a mistake on the little printed page that wasn't really mine, that I picked up from somewhere else and couldn't quite believe myself, that said that Jerome Rothenberg was born in 1921. All I can say is that he was born sometime between the death of Lord Byron [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5679] and now. [Laughter]. But I'm pretty certain that he wasn't around in 1921. So I'd like you to give a welcome to Jerome Rothenberg.

The birthdate'll come clearer in the second part of the reading. I'll read in two parts. And in the first set, what I'll be reading are translations and re-workings of American Indian poetry, which have been important to me over the last five or six years. And I'll start with some which are based on earlier translations, re-workings of material previously translated, and then as I get into it, some translations that result from direct contact and direct experience of American Indian poetry. This is an Aztec poem. The first four or five, six poems will be Aztec or Mexican in origin, and the theme will be flowers.  ""Offering Flowers"".

The name Wirikuta [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8026952] is the name given to the place of the gods, and the spiritual place of the Peyote. The Peyote is described as the rose, it's described as the corn, the maize, it's described under a number of images, and through the figure, the mythological figure of one called the Blue Stag. This is the first Huichol, Peyote song.

These are a few short Indian pieces. Not poems but part of what's connected with the whole activity of poetry, among the tribal peoples.

The next few are from a series of translations I've been doing, are called, well, it's the Seneca Indian word for one of their major curing ceremonies, a term for a major curing ceremony, ""Shaking the Pumpkin"", because the pumpkin rattle, the big pumpkin rattle is the major instrument used in this. Or it's got a more ornate name, it's called ""The Society of the Mystic Animals"". The man, Richard Johnny John, Indian, who is working with me on this, explained it's a serious ceremony, he said, but if everything's alright, the one who says the prayer tells them, I leave it up to you, folks, and if you want to have a good time, have a good time. Well everything's alright in the translations, you know, so one eases up there. The translations are done trying to follow everything in the Seneca, including the meaning of the sounds, the hey-ya and the way-oh-hey, that are very common in Indian poetry. Basically the way I do it is to present them visually on the page, and I can't do this in reading them, so I'm just going to select out of these poems that read easily. The purpose is curing, and well-being.

The next are a little harder to do, but I hope I make it. The Senecas don't use many words. It's a kind of minimal poetry and the power is in the compression. The Navajos use more words, the poetry gets dense, and in addition they use many many non-verbal sounds. And in addition, they distort many of the words in the singing. So that if you translate just for the meaning, you're only getting a small part of what the Navajo is doing. And then in addition, everything is sung in the Navajo. So I began to translate a series called, because that's what they are, ""The Seventeen Horse Songs of Frank Mitchell"". Seventeen horse-blessing, horse-curing songs that were the property of a Navajo medicine man named Frank Mitchell. And the problem that came up for me, I couldn't translate just for meaning, I wanted to, you know, consider all of the factors that went into the poem. So I began to insert sounds corresponding to the sound of the English words as the Navajo had the meaning of the sounds, and to distort the words. And then it seemed to me that it was necessary to carry this further, to begin to sing the songs as well. Which came to me with great difficulty. But I've gotten through a number of them now, and what I'll do is sing one, the ""Tenth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell,"" and then do a tape for three voices of another one of the horse songs. You'll notice the words are rather similar from one to another, the melody changes. In this, and the Navajos of course would know this, the hero, Enemy-Slayer, has gone to the house of his father, the sun up there, to bring back horses for the people. And in this Tenth Horse Song, it's mostly the father, the sun, speaking, telling him to bring the horses back to the house of his mother, you know, who everybody understands to be Changing Woman. Bring it back to the earth. And sometimes the voice of Enemy-Slayer comes into it.  But the basic refrain is to ""go to the woman, go to her.""

I think that's about all there is to say about it. Three voices.

Welcome to the...welcome to the fourth—third week of the fourth series of our readings here at Sir George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342] and this one is a special one, partly in that it was, it is being presented by a combination of the daytime Arts Student Association and the evening Arts Student Association, and not simply on the normal schedule. I'm certain that you don't have to be told who Allen Ginsberg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711] is, and you might think on how lucky it is that you happen to be in Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340] and he is here at the same time. Last night he was at York University [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q849751] in Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172], and tomorrow he's going to be in Ottawa [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1930], and we're going to sap an awful lot of his energy. Allen is, I think, the most noted poet we've had over the last couple of decades, in the world, and as you're going to find out and as you already know, one of the super-poets in terms of writing poetry, as well. I'd like to give you, without any more cogitation, Mr. Allen Ginsberg.

It's middle-sized, like, ten minutes, probably. What it is, is notations taken down in the course of one night in Cambodia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q424], in Siem Reap [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11711], which is outside of Angkor Wat [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43473], a town outside of the ruins.

I'm going to read my most personal poems, and start with the things that mean the most to me. These are poems that will soon be published in a collection that I think it's going to be called The Grand Concourse, that some of you will know is the main street in the Bronx. When I find out what people think of the sight of the Grand Concourse who don't know that it's the main street in the Bronx, you know, they think I'm pretty pompous, but you know it's just another version of something like Flatbush Avenue or something like that. How they got this kind of name for the Bronx, I don't know. This is a poem called, by the way, I don't think I'm going to say too much in between these poems, I'm just going to read them, unless something happens that I will particularly want to say.

This is a poem I recently finished, it's called ""The Quiet"", and it's his reply to me. Because you understand that, all of this weight of seriousness, is supposed to lift the whole scene, which is what it's all about, you know, just lift the whole thing. Not to go down, you know, but to just lift it. So this is his, I never read this one before, but this is his response to me.

I didn't read that too well, I really like that poem I don't want to mess it up, you know, but it's really very hard to be, to say a very, very tender kind of poem, because I'm not so tender, so I have a lot of trouble to be quiet, you know, because I can scream from here back to Brooklyn [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18419] if I wanted to. This is the last of the poems in this particular part of the sequence. It's a little poem called ""Surprise"", I read it this afternoon. I've had the most amazing response sometimes, at places, when I go very often to the anti-war readings I read these poems, very often this one. And it always sort of surprises me you know, that it's alright. ""Surprise"". Let me tell you a little about this situation--but if I tell you too much about it then I'll read it, you know, I can talk more and it's a little poem. But it was after a big war-type reading at the Loeb Center in New York, and after that, everyone went out, you know, and roaming around all night, and then about 4 am or something like that I got on the subway and went out to my parents' place in Rockaway [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62569], New York, on the ocean. And when I walked into the place, to their new house, I went to the--I walked in and saw that they were sleeping. And I had such a strong feeling, because when I was a kid, you know, and I used to come in late, either the door was locked, you know, the door was locked or there was this always this--come in after eleven, and you know, you won't get, you know, after eleven the door is locked, climb in through the fire escape or something. But here, you know, it was alright, and there it was and I stood and looked at them sleeping. They're both about 70. And by the way, extraordinarily happy. The poem is called ""Surprise"".

Now I have these three poems that I call the “Willow Poems”. One of them isn't finished, because the last two lines of the middle one are just, I got into a kind of pleasure in saying ""O"", you know, “Oh, Joy, Oh”, and like that and sometimes I just enjoyed it so much I was just kind of, and then it didn't mean anything, it you know, I was just kind of enjoying it, which is great, you know, but it's great to enjoy it and also is maybe good, so you make them together like that, so here are the three ""Willow Songs"". This one, well here it is, it's perfectly clear.

It's just like that beautiful girl, and you know, if you teach some place, what do you do? The last thing you do is hang around the school, stay away from it, you know, and so here I stay around the house, and here, I'm around the house during the day, you know, and so is this beautiful fifteen year old girl, and I'm watching her walk back and forth, you know, of course this is a song of innocence, you understand, this what she's got to worry about is me. Well I won't read the second one because the end of it isn't any good. But here is a little lyric, it's one of the Willow poems. I've written, it seems to me, an unusual number of poems that have something to do with my family. And whenever there's ever any suggestion of that kind coming from the world of important poetry, I really feel like just smashing somebody's head right in, nothing bothers me more than that, you know. The implication that something is important to you really isn't important, you know, just do what you please, that's all. But nevertheless, I do notice that there's a certain--sometimes I write a lot of these things. Here's a lyric. This is the last of them. It's a little poem.

Now this is a little different kind of series here. And this one is called, the first of these is called ""Summer's End"". This is a long poem that I wrote at a time, it's only some times that it's of any interest what these things develop out of, you know, but this one I think is kind of interesting. I had this very bad, I pulled a muscle in my calf, climbing a mountain, actually, in New Hampshire [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q759], where the mountains aren't too high, you know. And I was in a barn, I was at the MacDowell Colony [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3273867], and I was in a barn, and I couldn't get out, I couldn't move any place, I had one big jar, you know, next to the floor, sort of thing, and I just stayed there, and they would come around and bring me some food, finally about a week later I couldn't do anything and somebody--Hortense Calisher [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436082]--I don't know if you know who she is, just finally came along and took my car, drove me to the airport, and that was that, kept the car. But while I was lying there, I said there's no big deal about it, but I have had asthma since I was seven, and the one thing about that, you know a little bit like Proust [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7199], if you just lie around, you just lie there and then you sort of, alright, so here you are. So you just do something I guess, so this poem, ""Summer's End"", there are a lot of things you do with these things lying around. I'll tell you--""Summer's End"" alright, ""Summer's End"".

Here's a brand new one, this is the last poem I've written, this one. We could stop for a few minutes, you know, if you're tired. I'm really terrified usually before this begins, but once it's going, you know, then it's alright, it's really very good. It's called ""The Moment of No Recovery"". Excuse me, ""The Moment of No Recovery"". Maybe the first one is better than this one. ""The Moment of No Recovery"", ""The Moment of No Discovery"", no this is better. It has only the slightest bit to do, by the way, with a woman in my family who I've recently come to know about, her name is Minnie, she is an aunt, she's my father's sister, she's been in the Rockland State Hospital [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22061059] for over forty years. Only recently did I find out about her existence. And I remember when I talked to Allen  [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711], oh a few months ago, and he said something, he was just talking about the kind of people who are locked up, and he said it's like mini, you know, like mini, and I said that's it! My aunt Minnie, I have this aunt, and he said, well, go, go and see her. You know, what's happening there, how many times she could have been alright, well of course, this is just a little bit to her maybe, but I think I may have been thinking about it a little. Other things too. ""The Moment of No Recovery"". I have to learn, I think, how to read this poem.

I've written quite a lot about women, and I have read so many of those, I know, but here is one that is a poem about--titled ""Anne"". When I read this poem in a Pittsburgh [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1342] high school, about three weeks ago, the teacher decided to call the whole thing off. After I read it, after I read it, and somebody asked me about why I read it and I said I read it because I liked it very much and because I--it was about women, you know, and it was kind of a poem of praise about women, and at that point this woman got up and called and said we have to move the chairs into another room, that's actually what she said, we have to take some of these chairs into another room now, sorry. What a bitch. The worst I've ever seen, she was just unbelievable. Let's not have any doubts about her, it was the Langley High School [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15241542] in Pittsburgh. This poem is titled ""Anne"".

This poem is titled ""Chad Gadya: One Little Goat""--a Chad Gadya is a passover song and I assume it's a round that has its sense, the idea that God makes it right. It has just the tiniest little autobiographical fact about it, which is that my grandfather actually sold papers in Brooklyn, so this is the beginning of the thing.

That's a song of innocence. I remember I showed this poem to a student of mine who was in the Israeli army [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q58967], and he immediately said ""No, it's not like that, that's not--it's not like that"" and he described how someone had had his leg blown off and what he said, he didn't say anything like this at all, he said to me, he said something else, and so of course I didn't mean that's the way I thought war was. This is the last one I'm going to read and it's one I haven't read. It's called ""A Good Death"", and it's a poem for Henry Thoreau [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131149], it's ""A Good Death"" and it's for Henry Thoreau, and it's a century later. And it's the only time I tried, somebody just asked me, you know, it's to, to write something about Thoreau, which I thought would be absolutely impossible, but then as I started to read him, and I started to think of how I could never believe what he was saying, ever, like I could never believe so many affirmative, you know, things, and then I began to sort of see what--and I wrote this anyway. It was between Thoreau and me. You'll see what it sounds like.

Another Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639] night in the series, this will be, this is the final reading of the fall series, and will be picked up again in January. As you know from the propaganda sheets, we're presenting what I consider to be the centre of the Vancouver writing scene. Gladys Hindmarch has been in that scene for ten years, and was associated with all those people who've got all kinds of names over the last few years such as West Coast movement and the Tish movement and the New Wave Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] and that sort of business. And Stan Persky [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2330087], was as much related if not more because he is also a sort of superstar of little magazines [audience laughter] in San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62], and made the usual move up to Vancouver, what, three years ago? And has now become the superstar of the Vancouver writing scene. What's going to happen is that the reading will be split into two pieces. At the beginning, Stan is going to introduce Gladys, and then there will be a break of about ten minutes, and then Gladys is going to introduce Stan. So, I'd like to give you ""Stan and Gladys Evening"".

Another, I've got lots of others, but I'm just going to read one other short one that's got a number of daydream passages that I don't think I--it's necessary to know which of the day--I mean you can, I think you can get it, it's just call it ""Number 12"" right now it also hasn't got a title. ""Outside deck scene""--I guess that George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280] didn't say, I used to work as a mess girl and a cook on a West Coast freighter called the Tahsis Prince, I worked on four or five of them because I was relief working, but the main one I worked on went up the west coast of Vancouver Island [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170479], and not, they have great difficulty getting women to go out there, maybe obvious reasons in these stories so I could almost get a job on it, whereas the other ones I could get jobs if nobody was available, but since on this particular boat, usually nobody was available. One time I was leaving shopping in the Army and Navy and a guy came down the hall and said, Look you know, they're trying to get a hold of you, you've gotta go up there. And I said, come on, now, and sort of walked me back to the hall. And one Christmas run there were fifty one men--lots of people don't want to go out at Christmas, but a lot of the seamen, just work in the summer, so if they can get a job for two weeks they take it. They had fifty one cards on the board and not one of them--and there was a call for a cook, which was a girl's job and a call for an able seaman, and not one of the fifty-one men would go out on the boat--they got a guy who hadn't registered yet went out. This is an end of summer trip, it's not rough at all.

Stan and I both view Gertrude Stein as sort of eternal and I find that I can never read more than two pages of her at a time, like you just sort of become hypnotized, but she's pretty good to...like when I'm starting, trying to get into something to start to write and if I just read, you know just open one of her books at any sort of page, you know just at random and I just read two or three sentences, sometimes a paragraph, never more than that...and so I'm going to introduce Stan with a couple of Gertrude Stein sentences.  ""There's singularly nothing that makes a difference, a difference in beginning, and in middle, and in ending, except that each generation has something different at which they are all looking. By this I mean so simply that anybody knows it that composition is the difference which makes each and all of them then different from other generations, and this is what makes everything different, otherwise they're all like, and everybody knows it because everybody says it.""

...thing which is regularly said when introducing Robert Creeley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q918620] would be that he is a, a Black Mountain Poet [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2905420], and a colleague of Robert Duncan's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57421163], and the late Charles Olson's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q922978]. What has really introduced Robert Creeley to me however, was something I heard him say back in 1963, to the effect that when a man begins to love himself, love himself, to be in the world as he is in it, then things begin to happen to him that are interesting. Now, this is a statement, which is enigmatic in its syntax and yet still spells out what I think you will find interesting about Robert Creeley tonight, that is that he's a man whose poems are close to the process of living. He will be able to give you information in his poems about this process. His poems are about someone who, no matter how difficult this process has become, has loved that particular moment of it. Now that Robert is supplied with cigarettes for the evening, he may as well begin.

Then that--""things seem empty on vacation, if the labors have not been physical, then, some awful grating sound as if some monstrous nose were being blown..."" [begins to read “On Vacation”]--no I've read that once, I won't read it again. But I wanted to read the most recent--I used to have, not an ambition, but I had a lovely sense of Allen Ginsberg's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711] freedom in writing, happily, he's been here not too long ago. And I mean, Allen is a true contemporary, simply that we were born within say, what he's born--his birthday is June 3rd and mine's May 23rd of 1926 and we're, you know, we're very close in time and space. I used to have a sense of not Allen's permission in writing, I mean that permission doesn't exist. I mean, you write what you are given thus to write, nobody designs this occasion, nobody has the authority of it, and I did in a weird way, I envied Allen's ability to be where that situation might occur, you know. Like he could really write any moment, any place, anywhere, and so recently flying. In fact, last week, flying out to Los Angeles, not to Los Angeles, to San Francisco, I'd been awfully harassed in particular dilemmas of responsibility and suddenly sitting on the plane. There was this delicious space, you know, made peace with the plane by drinking everything they would give you instantly and having entered with some. I remember watching Warren, an old, dear friend get on a plane with like, four double vodkas. You know, I said ""Warren, you're going to get drunk"". He said, “No I'm flying back to Vancouver”. Like you mistaked the occasion, you know. And so, I get on the plane, and I thought, “well I can do this too”. And I wrote, my Bobbie who is a friend indeed of Robin's and myself. I'm literally her husband and Robin is a friend in that, what am I? I'm not going to propose that we're--no, but I think it's true. It has nothing to do with fucking. It has to do with the ambiance and reality of another human being. I think we share that reality in her. And she had gotten ill, unhappily and in some unexpected manner and then happily is now okay, but it was a crazy moment of dilemma. ""An Illness"".

I want to read one sequence of, a cluster of particular writing, I won't even have the arrogance to say these are necessarily poems. But the, because I don't in that sense, these are a sequence called ""In London"". And I had, I'll tell you, physically, the circumstance was that I was in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84?wprov=srpw1_0] for five days last summer for a particular activity and I have happily a number of friends in London. Therefore, generously and, actually my time is really filled with seeing particular friends or else having particular business to conduct, and that's one, frankly, one of the satisfactions of one sense of what my life has to do with its own occasion, to have use and to have place. Not to say, “Gee, you're back again. We've kept the table. We've kept the seat for you”. But to have an occasion that actually gives you place in the world is always a delight. And so therefore, I was there briefly and this particular morning, there was to have been a, actually, a recording and it turned out the circumstances of the recording hadn't worked out. So the people involved did not come and so there was a space of three hours in which I was staying at this friend's apartment in London on Wimpole Street, 76 Wimpole Street, just around Oxford Street. You know the neighborhood possibly. And it's a dazzling part of London for an American. Particularly, I mean, it's like Barrets and Wimpole Street and the whole bit, Paul McCartney [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2599?wprov=srpw1_0] had a place, like two blocks--did have a place two blocks--and the whole bit. You know, and it's very dazzling, and I was in this apartment and I was sleeping actually on the couch of this particular friend, and there were other beds available, but I did not manage. I was not aggressive, so therefore I slept on the couch. It was a heavy time for everybody, and I was thinking of Jim dying, you know whose “A Retrospective of the Whitney” has just opened. And I was staying, actually, with the wife of a publisher who happily I have in London, John Calder [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6224786] and Marion Boyars [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18674153]. I was thinking of John Calder's apartment and John and his wife unhappily were having a, I mean, it's ridiculous, I'm not going to rehearse the whole situation of their lives, man. Like we've got enough to enter my own in that way, but the point is that I was sleeping on their couch, right? Everybody had left for their various activities and I was to meet these people to come in and set up this recording equipment and have this scene, and they didn't show up. And I had literally like two or three hours just in that apartment. I was padding around the place in my jammies, feeling beautifully luxurious and relaxed in London, you know, like digging out the window. I'd been the night previous reading at an International Festival of Poetry on a beautiful occasion, and I'd gone over. Jim Dine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q531234] is frankly a friend from the States and I'd called him up, he's living in, where the hell does he live, Grosvenor square [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q932992], he's like in that district. He's living next to the Uruguay Embassy, like it's a very- he's running a house that somebody is trying to sell, but they can't find an appropriate buyer. Mick Jagger [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128121] wanted to buy the house, but they didn't want a rock singer, and then the Nigerian Embassy wanted to buy the house but they didn't want to sell, you know. It was a whole trip. So Jim Dine has maintained the premises. So I go there and say ""Terrific"" and ""Wow"". We do the whole American bit, which is frankly to get over excited instantly, and to eat, drink, and be merry with an absolute insistence. And we're now driving over to make the Royal Festival Arts blah, blah, blah scene. And for an American it's a heady trip. I'm going to read now in company with the company of four other people, as part of the International Festival of Poetry and they're having this scene at a place, those of you who know London, they're having a scene at the Queen Elizabeth Hall [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1622428], that's part of the festival, you know like, complexes across the Thames [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19686] from the Parliamentary buildings, Tower of London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62378], all that. So we're driving  through late London afternoon in July, delicious, I mean, the sun is fading in over those buildings the whole, oh wow, you know, just blow your mind. It's just fantastically tender and real, and that's where Raleigh [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189144] was imprisoned in the Tower, and that's you know, fantastic. We arrive in absolutely pristine condition, and it took about two minutes to 'x' it all out. So the first two poems--it says “Festival Hall London”, like a note to myself on the side, and the first two poems--like the unrelieved tedium of the evening was just fantastic. I talked to a reporter of like a red rag, a socialist paper in London later. He said, “I don't see any reason why you should show up, Mr. Creeley, before you're required, your presence is literally required”. You know, so I said, “Do you really think that's possible? Do you think I really could do that?”. He said “I don't see any reason why your condition and duty doesn't permit that kind of occasion”, and I said “The hardest thing man is to sit there for like, it isn't the tedium of the people, it's the tedium of the occasion, it's like all these people. I have to have a rock in my pants that I thought it was hashish but it's actually three million, billion years old, it's a worm. We've got time, right?”. So he said “You don't have to”--what was your experience--he's trying to get some, you know he's trying to get some sense of the work as we're not permitted into the reading or something [audience laughter] and I quote the work as we're like generously absent from the reading, like you don't have to do that too, there's going to be a condition of that experience. ""In London""

[Interrupts reading]. Let me interpolate, Chamberlain [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q468760] at one point had a weird erotic scene where they were making love by telephone. Have you ever tried that number? So John was was making things like sperm omelet, like he really, somehow it arrived in his madness of mid age, and decided that he was really going to go for broke in terms of sexual possibility. You ever see a man from Indiana take off on the possibilities of sexual endeavor? It's like- so John, Ultra Violet was the perfect foil for this condition. Ultra Violet [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q272994], if you've seen, you must have seen her on the Merv Griffin Show [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3404046], Ultra Violet like is like the most humorless, John had a tape of her singing ""The Fool on the Hill'' [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1920202] that went on for weeks. It was like years would pass by. “Ze fool on ze hill”, you know. With this incredibly corny french accent. ""Ze fool on ze hill"" I remember, and he had a scene where they would make love like- I remember one time, the only, the first time I met- oh christ, I'm suddenly flipped out in my own mind, oh hell. It's ridiculous. Well, see, John had a studio on 13th Street and First Avenue, and Larry Rubens had a studio also, and a Japanese girl had a studio, and upstairs was like, directly over John's studio was, oh hell, who's the obvious sculpture, someone supply me with a name, it's ridiculous, the greatest imagination in the arts today in terms of this environment, [audience suggests name] Pardon? No, not Segal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q703624]. Like Oldenburg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q156731], Claes Oldenburg. Claes Oldenburg lived upstairs and then he was still with his wife, his crazy factory, the industry, like making the ghosts, I mean they were making the mock-ups of the particular sculptures he was involved in and John, for example, would like wake up, you'd hear like- I spent nights in John's place and you'd hear the radio would turn on, in the morning, like to station k-whatever it was and then you'd hear them moving around getting breakfast and then hear the sewing machine start and the day would begin and Claes Oldenburg has a crazy serious humorous, like the peculiar to my- I was talking to someone about being, you know, coming from Nova Scotia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1952], or New Brunswick [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1965] or St. John's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2082] I mean like the [unintelligible] scene is very displaced by that Scandinavian economy, you know, of experience. So John was- do things like one night for an example, he and Ultra Violet had this thing going with the telephone and she called him and he happened to be out and she just let the phone ring. The phone rang from 11:00 to 7 in the morning [laughter.] Like it just keeps ringing. I remember I met Claes Oldenburg that morning, he said ""John, someone was trying to call you last night"" [laughter] and John says ""Yeah, I know."" It was lovely, yeah. “I got the message”. And that was all either one of them said.

That I, this was a--one time back in the earlier part of the 60's, Ginsberg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711] was given a tape recorder by Bob Dylan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q392] and when they were both in San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62]. Dylan gave Allen a Uher tape recorder and they had been in San Francisco, now Allen went down to Los Angeles [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q65] and he talked to people like Gerald Heard [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1606714], he had long conversations with Lenny Bruce [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q460876], and he also went to see Maria Huxley, and he was particularly interested as to what were Huxley's, not merely, he knew what Huxley died of, Huxley died of cancer in a factual and actual manner. But he was very interested into what was Huxley's not state, like he didn't want to hear his last words in some awful sense, but he wanted to know what kind of experience of death Huxley had had. And if this particular experience of death had been in any way informed by the circumstance of experience that Huxley had begun to be more and more involved with as he grew older, namely acid and the transformation, not the transformation but the particularization of experience that he found in the psychedelic so-called drugs. And so he asked Maria Huxley the very obvious question, “was Huxley on acid when he died? Did he take acid previous to his death?” And she said, “well, he had asked that when he was thus conscious. I mean he did go into a coma. He did have a float, physically, and he asked that he have acid available. I mean that the cap of acid be place conveniently by the bed, and that he would obviously determine when and as and if he wanted to take it. It would be there. It would be like an aspirin, like a glass of water,” and she said that roughly half an hour previous to his physical death, he took acid. And then Allen asked the other obvious question, did he say anything? Did he say anything of the experience of the circumstance? She said, no he didn't, he said nothing. But this is a woman who'd lived obviously with this man for a particular length of time and had information specifically, she said no, but there was this beatific smile, he was attending his own, you know, like he was attending, not the apocalypse, but the phenomenality of his own dispersion into you know other states of being, with the agency that's created.

...he didn't want to make it hard for anybody, certainly didn't want to make it thus easy. But, particular information was always of that nature, you couldn't describe it, you certainly couldn't make it a convenience, so that the actuation of it for you always had to be the particular resource and fact of your own--I mean, it had to be that you did know it. It wasn't like one-upping, ""Gee, you don't know the name of the capital of Madagascar"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1019?wprov=srpw1_0], like I don't know the name of the capital of Madagascar, is there a capital of Madagascar? I guess, you couldn't. That wasn't the condition, but if something was there to be known, that was of some particular interest to him, he gave you the fact of that interest and the substance of that interest, but he didn't give you the convenience of that interest, you had not merely to track his experience into it, but you had to get there, like you had to get there by your own agency. But I think I could--someone said, like man, like the dots in this particular book, pieces, and there's a lovely remark by Ed Dorn [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5334756] whom I dearly love, he said you know, that sense of the pieces of the definition, [unintelligible] of the parts of some of the imagined whole, which these pieces are then the fragments or the parts of, then he says, he effectually suggests, think of a situation where the pieces do not compose that possible containment, the parts that do not necessarily relate and or have the substance of the whole thus to inform them. Like now, you're really in a hole, dig. And his definition of tradition: that which someone comes carrying the information of, literally, he got there, with the news. So the dots in this book, the three dots, those of you who are interested in these explications of text, these three dots simply indicate the intervals of a particular sitting, or a particular, you know literally, you see how this is written, it's like in a notebook, well what was written on a particular day would be separated in this text by three dots, you know, like usually the particular things written would be separated by one dot then when another day occurred there'd be three dots, I mean it's a very rudimentary division.

Introducer
00:00:00
Our poet this evening, Diane Wakoski [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1209000], by birth and education a Californian, has been a central figure on the New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] scene, poetry scene, since 1961 or 62. She first came to attention outside New York City, with the publication of the small, but now somewhat legendary anthology Four Young Lady Poets. Since then, she has published nine volumes of poems, including Coins and Coffins, Discrepancies and Apparitions, The George Washington Poems, Inside the Blood Factory, Greed, and The Magellanic Clouds which I believe is to come out this year. I understand that some critics have tended to assign some of her recent work to so-called confessional school, which in her case means very little except that she writes about her own pictures of herself. Contrary to what one associates with the term confessional, Miss Wakoski writes a poetry that is syntactically direct and undeceiving. Yet, it is at the same time openly adventurous in its vocabulary, full of excitement and risk. It is thus a poetry that may perplex you, not because you do not understand it however, but because you do. And it's certainly one that you will enjoy hearing. Miss Wakoski, Diane!

Will you fall asleep if we don't have more lights on? I fall asleep in very dark rooms, I'm very loath to let the audience fall asleep, at least just for lights. If you can't hear me, I think there are more seats up here. This first poem I'm going to read is a poem that I wrote to a young poet a few years ago, I guess he's not so young anymore, but he was young when I wrote it, and he came to visit me in New York City to show me his poems, which were very nice poems, but he had been studying with Robert Creeley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q918620], whom I very much admire, but who sort of has the kiss of death for any sensitive young man who studies with him, because they all come away looking like Robert Creeley, sounding like Robert Creeley and writing exactly like Robert Creeley. And I'm not exactly known for my tact, so when he asked me about his poems, I said I thought they were very nice Robert Creeley imitations. And he walked away in a huff, and I realized what a message that is constantly being communicated to women in our culture that even though we are asked to be able to think and act intelligently, when it really comes down to the nitty gritty, we are expected to compliment men and not to tell them what we really think. So I wrote him an apology. I'm not really apologizing for what I said, I'm apologizing for being a graceful enough woman in that situation. And this poem, I think, says very much what I would like to say to all of you who wrote poetry who are young, or who do anything else. ""An Apology"".

I don't really believe that, as I say. But I do believe in the necessity of having to say it. This next poem I'd like to read is a poem in which, again, I ask a kind of rhetorical question that is a very meaningful one for all women in our culture. I think, by the way, that in spite of the fact that I constantly talk about what problems women do have in a contemporary society that at last has freed them from the burden of constant babysitting and washing and ironing and so forth, that the whole mix up of what roles are about makes the life of a woman very hard, but I think that really, it's probably a man's role, it's harder to play the woman and my experience has been most of the time when women are punished in our society or have real problems with being women it's because they are getting the feedback from how complicated and impossible the demands on men have been and the men are feeding it back to them and if maybe we could ever solve that real dilemma of what the complete man is allowed to be, then women wouldn't suffer. I don't really think that anything women can do will do any good until the man's world is a more possible one to live in. At any rate, this poem asks a question that I constantly ask, why is it when a woman who shows strength, strength is something that we should all be honoured for having and being able to live with in our life, why should a woman be punished for her strength? As strong women often are. It's called ""Slicing Oranges for Jeremiah"".

I'm very interested in, well, actually, something that all poets are involved in, and that is trying to use the mythology of their culture to somehow be able to talk about their own personal realities and still be able to communicate with other people in terms of kind of common cultural experience. And I've been writing a series of poems that I call the ""George Washington [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23] Poems"" to help me do this and every once in a while I will pick up on other things also and something that's always fascinated me, being from California [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99], are the legends of the Wild West [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190267] and the way people still sort of look at Americans as pioneers and cowboys and in a way how we like to flatter ourselves, all of us that we have a certain kind of ruggedness because of this pioneer tradition. But one of the confusions that has grown up out of that cultural image is again, something that concerns me very much, as women, we've all been brainwashed to fall in love with men who have this very rugged image who are able to do tough rugged things, and unfortunately, reality doesn't always live up to those images that are presented to us so we're falling madly in love with these men who turn out to often not like women, because that whole western life was geared for men, and not for women. So in this poem I'm lodging my protest officially. It's called ""Follow that Stagecoach"".

This next poem is about an idiosyncrasy that I have, I can't stand men who wear rings on their little fingers. and I wrote this poem, oh, a few years ago when I went to the Guggenheim [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201469] in New York City to hear a poet that I admire a lot, Gary Snyder [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315963], I like that whole, very masculine image he presents, some guy in the woods chopping down trees, working in a lumber mill and things like that. So, it was really a very great shock to see him appear on stage with his lumber boots, his blue jeans, his work shirt, his tweed jacket with a leather patch and a ring on his little finger. So I went home and wrote this poem. It's called ""Ringless"".

Another one of my heroes is Beethoven [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q255], this is Beethoven's two-hundred centennial by the way. I like Beethoven for a lot of reasons, but I suppose why I pick on him to talk about is that Beethoven stands for the ability to use anger and make it into something very beautiful and powerful. Again, we live in a culture that makes life very difficult for us and one of the things we're taught as children is that to express anger is a bad thing, not that it's a natural, healthy thing and that in fact until the anger is expressed, the love can't exist. So I'm going to read this poem which is called ""In Gratitude to Beethoven"".

...poets in the world I assume. I wrote a poem about landing on the moon. The moon traditionally is poet's subject and I suppose I feel even more involved, since my name is Diane and I've always felt that either the moon belonged to me, or that I was the moon, so having it landed on gave me a lot of complicated feelings. And I wrote this poem called ""The Ten Dollar Cab Ride"", which is dedicated to Robert Duncan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q964391], because he once told this story, some of you must know this, I don't think he wrote it in any of his poems, I once heard him tell the story but it could easily be in one of his poems. It was about a number of years ago when he was much, much younger and his life was much more difficult than it is right now and I guess one of his problems was money and money tends to get people very depressed at times, and he was depressed about everything else and he also didn't have any money so he decided he was going to kill himself, and he didn't really want to do it right that minute. But he wanted to do it, and all he had was ten dollars and so he decided he would take a cab ride and when the ten dollars was up, he'd get out and kill himself. But he made the fatal mistake, or I should say the life-giving mistake, of going for a cab ride in Golden Gate Park [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q635559] in San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62] which is very, very beautiful and by the end of his ten dollars, he felt so good that he had to get out and walk home. I always thought that was a hopeful story for any of us. Anyway, ""The Ten Dollar Cab Ride"" for Robert Duncan.

To me some of these poems are remarkable because at the time I didn't know this marriage was breaking up and some of the, some of the poems as you can see are about experiences other than marriage and suddenly I realize of course as these poems were progressing, in particular toward the end, that the message was certainly that there was something rather infertile in my whole life, I mean even in the next poem I'm going to read, I didn't catch on, I thought, 'oh well, I'll write this poem, I can't really show it to my wife, but you know, so what'.

Well by this point in the sequence, the message was beginning to become more available to me. I was, I admit beginning to understand what I was writing by this point. I've always felt that it's important to write a poem whether or not you realize its significance or its relevance to your own life that you go ahead and write the poem anyway. And in this particular sequence, my own faith that poetry can reveal things to you, that the process of writing poems is a process of discovery, that in fact poems teach the poet, rather than the poet teaching the poems. The poems are wiser than the poet, if you want to look at it that way. This was--seemed to be borne out.

Many ways experience played into the hands of the poems, very nice that the most disastrous years of that marriage happened to begin in a summertime situation, and to end in winter, so that the seasonal, the cycle of the seasons could play its part in the poem. But on the other hand, perhaps that wasn't accidental. One doesn't want to question these things after they've worked for you. Group of poems that are collected in the book, which Howard Fink spoke about in his introduction, Four Myths for Sam Perry.

Drongo is a purple bird that is peculiar to Southeast Asia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11708], one of the things which is never really thought of in times of conflict are all of the more, well very specific natural features of the landscape which of course are threatened by destruction in such times. We think of the problems of the defoliant in South Vietnam, when what they estimate now that more than 10% of the country has been treated with defoliant. We don't think of the individual examples of the flora and fauna which may be threatened with extinction because of this defoliation. Man of course is only one of the many inhabitants of this planet and although it is certainly a despicable thing that the biological function of human beings have been interfered with by the defoliation, children are being born malnourished, these are not the only sufferers.

Well actually for the past three years I've been writing poems, from the tarot pack. I've been somewhat disappointed to learn that all kinds of other poets have been doing this at the same time. They're getting their stuff into print but I haven't bothered because I was going to do all 88 cards and publish them all at once. At any rate, I'm going to say some more about the tarot pack later but this particular poem comes out of the tarot pack from the Emperor card and has a peculiar affinity to the poems I've just been reading.

The next poem is entitled ""A Light Poem"". For lack of a better descriptive term, I might call myself an anti-humanist, this is of course the--it's almost become a category, I thought it was unique at one point, but it's become of late a category. I think more and more people are realizing that man is not capable of appointing himself as manager, or he's capable of appointing himself, he's not capable of acting out his self-appointment as manager of this planet. That in fact, his capabilities at managing certain areas create problems that are multiples of the ones he has solved. And that the humanist dream of man through his own rationality creating a nearly utopian existence, coming to understand the workings of the universe in such a way that he can bend them to his own use, but this dream has not going to come true. And of course, one of the ways that this feeling in men has been manifested has been his utilization of light and energy, and well, to the poem. ""A Light Poem"".

Recently I have been writing poems from tarot cards. I have noticed a couple of things about the tarot cards that are very important for the poems. One of these is that the female symbol seems to be the most important symbol in the deck and it seems to suggest that the universe itself is essentially feminine in nature, that the fertility of the universe is feminine. Another aspect of the cards suggests that the nature of the universe is such that all sorts of mysterious things can happen to it without our understanding them. That there are all sorts of forces indicated in these cards that are essentially outside of our control. This poem, entitled ""To Win at Cards"". Tarot cards are not cards whose primary purpose is to play a game. The decks of cards with which we are all familiar with are cards where you play a game, the object of course of playing cards is to win at cards. And winning of course, is something which we are all brought up to wish, so one of the things about our competitive society that makes it work is that we all want to win. And card games help indoctrinate us in this direction. Cards, can also tell you things, this is the thing that the tarot cards have in common with poetry, is that people don't win in poetry, you don't write a better poem than somebody else in order to win prizes or to--you don't use poems in order to seduce a girl, or you don't use poems in order to accomplish any kind of end outside of the end of writing the poem. If you do, your allegiance is not to the poem and it's to something else and you're prostituting the poem. The only thing which can win at poetry is the poem itself, and this is where the poet ought to apply his effort to, is to helping the poem win.

Throughout history of course, men have been obsessed with the idea of being displaced by another man. Either in the seat--in the kingdom, or in the favors of the special woman in their lives. We have in mythology of course, many myths of Gods being displaced very often by their children. In Greek drama of course, the classical example is the Oedipus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130890] myth where Laius [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463898] and Jocasta [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131445] have their married lives disrupted by their son, Oedipus. This is a poem about this particular fear. Fear of being displaced by someone younger, very often, fear of being displaced by one's own son, although that's not necessarily integral to the poem.

When I started to write poems about sixty-eight years ago, Bliss Carman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3068116] was the only one writing. So I imitated Bliss Carman, and this first poem is a sort of imitation of Bliss Carman. [Audience laughter]. And there are hardly any new poems in there because it takes me two years to revise them for two years and then conclude them in a reading, and then besides which as George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280] said, I've joined the academics because all the American members of the department at Simon Fraser have guilty consciences so they wanted a Canadian on staff [audience laughter].  ""About being a member of our armed forces"". This is, this is thirty years after I started to write poems. Remember--Oh, I should say, there are two, three phrases in this that would not ordinarily be understood by you people. ""Zombies,"" who were conscripts in the last war, and well, the CWACs were women members, Canadian Women's Army Corp [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5030688].

But when they saw the poems, and of course it wasn't because they were bad poems, I'm sure, he didn't want to do the illustrations anymore, they said they were hard-boiled. As I said, they can't be bad poems. This was one of them. It's got...no, I don't think I'll read that anyway. I don't like it. However, here's another one along the same lines. [Audience laughter]. It's called ""With Words, Words"".

I lived in Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639] for a while, and up till 1955 or 6. The first play I wrote for CBC [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461761] was accepted, and I thought I was a genius, and moved to Montreal  [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340] in order to reap the rewards of my genius. For a year in Montreal I think my...I sold a couple of adaptations to CBC. And eventually we moved to Roblin Lake [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22447801], near Ameliasburgh [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4742321] in Ontario [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904], and built a house. And my wife having quit her job, she having decided that if I could get away without working she could too. So we sat down for a couple of years looking at each other, waiting for the other one, to see which one would break first. But this is a poem about that particular time, called ""One Rural Winter"".

Screwed that up, I guess. You get tired of reading your own stuff, after a while. You forget what it sounded like the last time. This is a poem I kind of like but I keep revising it also, or have been several times in the last few years, called ""Dark Landscape"". It uses a couple of lines from an American poet who died thirty years ago called Vachel Lindsay [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1197667], whom probably nobody ever heard of. And it starts in a very prosy way, and is meant to sound that way, and then the rhythm quickens. ""Dark Landscape"".

And he also had ""Aladdin to the jinn"", except that Aladdin to the jinn, his jinn was J-I-N-N and mine was two J-I-N-N's, and one G-I-N. So that, always a little difficult to understand it without seeing it on the page. Kind of a sweet little poem, this was after we moved to Roblin Lake, and as I say, I sold a couple of plays and we bought a pile of used lumber with the proceeds and put the down payment on the lot and build this house.

When I...when we first moved down to Ameliasburg, or to Roblin Lake, I should say, because Roblin Lake where we are is about a mile or so from Ameliasburg...I, after Montreal, and after the job I'd had in Vancouver, I suddenly had to become my own disciplinary straw boss, and it was quite difficult, and in other words, you know, I'd try to get up at a certain hour of the day and start writing. Which I could always, you know, I can always write prose, whenever I feel like it, but poems, I write them, well, I should say, I write poems whenever I feel like it, but you can, I can regimen my own prose, which I don't do much of these days. Anyway, when we moved to Roblin Lake, I wasn't physically regimented myself, so that I was waking up all hours of the day. And this is a short poem about that, but I also screwed up the poem, because I put lines at the end of, or words at the end of each line so that I don't know where the emphasis should be placed, even though I've read it dozens of times. It's called ""Late Rising at Roblin Lake"".

And...it was after quite a turbulent evening with my friend in Belleville [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34227], Ontario, we decided to get a couple of bottles of liquor and go out to the country where we wouldn't be disturbed, and drink it. But the farmer phoned the cops, and we were both thrown in jail. And this particular poem is about the first part of that experience, I mean the early part of being thrown in jail, more or less. But not the end of it, it turned into a sort of fantasy that means something other than I intended.

And after having lived in Vancouver, I learned how to make wine of one kind or another, and there was no way to, I didn't have enough money to make beer, so there were a lot of wild grapes around there and we made, I made wild grape wine, and one time, one particular season, I had about five hundred bottles.

A year and a half after I got back from the Arctic, I got a bill for a hundred and ten dollars from the construction company that I thought I'd, whose plane I thought I'd hitchhiked on. Which I haven't paid. But anyway, all of these poems, except perhaps I think one or two, were written up there, written in the Arctic, except that after I got back from the Arctic I kept revising them.

The business about the caribou draining in the bilge water was one of the reasons, I suppose, I found it so extraordinary that, perhaps, that Eskimos should enjoy these shoot-em-up movies, was that they had just come a hundred miles or so after shooting caribou, bringing them back to Pang, Pangnirtung on the, on the Sound, on the...jeez, my memory's failing, I can't even remember the fjord it was. But anyway, they had just shot them and come a hundred miles back with them, and yet...and they were draining in their Peterhead boats, and yet they found these movies so exciting--I suppose I shouldn't find that so unusual, but I do.

I want to read at least one about, about, about people there, because I used to, when I was on these islands, [inaudible] Islands in Cumberland Sound, the Eskimo women used to come over every day and drink tea. They could not speak any English and I could speak no Eskimo, and I would feed them tea and we would sit there, myself feeling about as silly as I could, so eventually I grew a bit desperate and I would read them poems and I would sing songs or I'd do any damn thing. However, eventually there was some kind of, I think, positive liking on my part. But this poem may express it as well as anything. ""Wash Day"".

Talking about shit, there's actually a poem that has a little bit to do with it here. The Arctic dogs have some qualities that are more pronounced and magnified in Arctic dogs than in southern dogs, that is, they like to eat the stuff. So that when you go, as all, everybody must go at some time or other in their lives, possibly once a day or not, one takes an Eskimo kid along to throw stones and keep the dogs off. When I came back from the Arctic I saw an hour-long film about the George River [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q966023] Eskimos, and one scene in it showed about fifty Eskimos trying to get into a tent, and the Eskimos beating them into the tent, and the next thing you showed the same dogs trying to get out of the tent and the Eskimos beating them out of the tent. And the announcer said not one single word. And then I remembered that whenever the Eskimos leave a campsite, they use it for a privy, and then send the dogs in to clean up. So, actually, this is a poem about that.  ""When I Sat Down to Play the Piano"". [Audience laughter].

And so that none of you lose any sleep tonight, the uniform is genuine United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] Merchant Marine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q865132] uniform and the fifth stripe, the purple stripe denotes me as a chief poet, which I was appointed by three captains, two chief engineers and several assorted mates of United States lines and we invented the uniform one night and they threw in all the materials and my wife gave it to me for a Christmas present, so I am responsible for the moral, religious, emotional and sexual life of the crew while at sea. It's a very serious duty! The book that's out now is actually my fourth book of poems, the first to some of you may be familiar with some of the poems from The New American Poetry [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7753501]and so on, The Dutiful Son and The Love Bit. And In Time is the fourth book. The third book is a little known book because Jonathan Williams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6274797] has been carrying it around in his briefcase for eight years and sends me postcards every six month saying he's bringing it out. I thought maybe since it probably will never get published I should read some poems from there, it's called Friends and Lovers and most of the poems have initialed inscriptions, some of which I will name to you, and some of which somebody going for his Master's thirty years from now will have to do a lot of research to figure out. It's divided into two parts, obviously in the first part is friends and in the second part is lovers. This is the dedicatory poem. ""Orpheus"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q174353].

I'm not sure I like this poem but the story behind it is funny. The really, the fairest break-up, for very strange reasons, and this one literally broke up because the first day that the chick made me sunny-side up eggs, she mashed the yolk with her fork. [Audience laughter]. I knew that no matter how beautiful the scene had been I couldn't stay there anymore. It's called ""Purple Flowers"" and it's for S.G., wherever you might be.

Nobody liked it. Dan Rice is the only person in the world I know that likes that poem. And I think it's the best poem I ever wrote. This is a poem for the other poet I have to most love for, Li Po [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7071], the Chinese poet from 700, 800, roughly. It's called ""shooting the moon"". Li Po, his particular distinctions were that he seduced the emperor of China's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q148] favourite courtesan, and showed up two hours late for the date, bombed out of his skull, and fell asleep on her bosom before doing anything, and the emperor was not terribly amused by it but at the same time he was impressed by the enormity of the action so he exiled him to the mountains but he gave him like 50 thousand acres and bread for life, it's just he was not to show up in court ever again. While there, he did several notable things, one of which is writing the best lush poem that's ever been written cause he got up on a beautiful spring day and was sitting out on his terrace and his servant brought him breakfast and he ate it and he started drinking some sake and the next thing he knew it was nine o'clock at night and like he had sorta missed spring so he started drinking again, and the last line of the poem is something like ""two hours later I was dancing with the moon"". So, he worked it out. The only problem was, that he was literally in love with the moon, and this image runs through his poem, and one night on the way home from a wine tavern, he decided finally to make it with the moon and he sat down at the edge of the river, left it under a rock with his clothes and dove in to screw the moon, literally, the reflection in the water, and drowned. And one hopes that--I don't know what the autopsy showed, but one hopes that he did make it before he drowned, you know, like, you have to love, you know, a guy like that.

I thought that what I'd do first is read to you from the Vancouver Poems, which won't be published with a 'the', I hope. I guess I'll just try and explain allusions as I go along for those people who have never been to Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639] or know it because the poems tend to be pretty local, as they were intended to be, and I'll read you two quotes that I have at the beginning because they might help to explain certain concerns in the poem. The first one's from Rimbaud [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q493], it's from a letter of his in which he was talking about his new conception of the poet and how the poet writes, and he said simply ""Je est une autre."" The second quote is from a record recently released by Randy Newman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q318475], this is from one of his songs: ""She say I talk to strangers if I want to, 'coz I'm a stranger too"". These are all prose poems. Lagoon is Lost Lagoon, it's supposed to be lost because it was cut off from the sea by man-made walk, and there's a sort of local myth among the kids growing up there that Lost Lagoon is lost too, because it has no bottom, nobody has ever found the bottom. ""Lagoon"".

The first poem in the book is sort of a, an entranceway to the book as a whole, it in some ways it sets up my method, I originally had, I'd been reading a lot about Japanese Noh plays, and I'd especially been interested in the Spirit Plays and my original figure in here was a Shite, who is the doer, the central figure in the Noh, who performs the dance and who the particular Noh is about. He usually first appears in the spirit plays as an old man, an old fisherman, or salt-gatherer, some kind of beat down, destitute person, an anonymous person, and the Waki comes along and somehow starts up a conversation and begins to wonder about this man, and usually asks him to tell him the story of the place where he is, assuming that this is some sort of historical shrine, which it often is, and the Waki has come specifically to see this place and as the old man begins to tell the story, he, well, there's actually a scene change, an act change, he reappears in all his glory as the original person whose life was lived out, usually tragically and very dramatically, often in a battle, who died in this place and whose spirit consequently haunts the area. Then I started reading about the Kwakiutl who are a tribe of the Indians somewhat to the north of Vancouver, about the furthest south they reach is the Campbell River [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270481] on Vancouver Island [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170479] which is, I don't know how many miles north of Vancouver, 100? 80, about 80. But I always figured that there must have been some sort of interchange between the Kwakiutl and the Salish, the particular tribe around the Fraser Delta [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q269710]  in Vancouver. The thing that interested me the most about the Kwakiutl were one particular secret society called the ""Hamatsa"" and in the Hamatsa it writes, one goes into a sort of frenzy and is possessed by the original spirit, who then passed on the rituals, and the frenzy denotes the acquirement of a certain kind of power. I guess the Salish have something a little corresponding to that in that they have, I don't know what you call them, they're certain kinds of dances which are meant to perform the meeting between the individual who dances, the initiate, and the spirit of the particular place whom he encounters and who gives them, in result of this dance, particular powers. ""Wet fur wavers"", this is a Spanish Banks [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7573148] poem, about a walk, a Sunday walk along the Spanish Banks.

And straight from that to another one that's somewhat linked up to that in terms of its content. This is about the public library, the old Carnegie Library [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1376408], which is, has since been closed down because the library rebuilt in an up-town area, the old Carnegie Library is located in the heart of skid row and used to be frequented mainly by old men reading who were reading newspapers who were trying to escape from the eternal rain and the cold.

The next one which is also linked, I should have mentioned before the last one that the White Lunch--it must be a Vancouver phenomenon because I don't think I've seen it anywhere else. It's a chain of self-serve cafes, restaurants, and they're inexpensive of course, and their symbol outside is a huge white teacup and saucer, with these little coloured stooped figures running, eternally running around the saucer. This next poem is about a woman whose name I didn't know, I attributed a name to her, Emma. She could be seen, often around Berrard and Granville streets, and instead of going into the White Lunch, she used to go into the Bay, Hudson's Bay [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q641129], and sit on the benches outside the elevator, and wait to warm up, I guess. Often, she seemed to me to be just to be interested in watching the weird kind of people who used to shop at the Bay, all those people with money. ""Razor Back Woman"" is taken from a John Stewart [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1393453] album, lyric of his.

One last one that connects with the Kwakiutl Hamatsa society, this is going to need some explanation. Baxbakwalanuksiwe’, is--and I'm not responsible for my pronunciation for any people here who know how Kwakiutl sounds, because I don't--I'm just picking it up from various spellings and he was the original spirit who informed the Hamatsas, who gave them their cannibal right because an Indian managed to overcome him, through a trick.

00:14:48
Which one is that? Which name?

Daphne Marlatt
00:14:50
Hamatsa--Baxbakwalanuksiwe’. He was supposed to have been the first man, the first one to eat man at the mouth of the river, that's a quote. He was a sort of bird-like, obviously inhuman creature whose body was covered all over with mouths and he used to have various attendants around, and one of whom was a woman who was rooted to the floor of his cabin and she was very beautiful, and she used to lure people in who then became his victims. But in this particular occasion, these three Indian brothers somehow won her sympathy or something, but she told them, Baxbakwalanuksiwe’ was out at the moment, she told him that he would be expected back and that they were supposed to be his victims, and that the only way to overcome this was to build, to dig a deep pit in the floor, cover it over with boughs and then and have a trap that he could spring, that could release the boughs, and then when he did his dance, prior to killing and eating his victims, they would just pull the string or whatever it was and he would then fall into the pit. And then they could set fire to him. Qominaga is the woman, and I don't know if I should explain the B.C. [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1974] liquor laws or not. [Audience laughter]. Well, for those of you who don't know B.C., up until not so very long ago, what, five? No, must be longer than that, maybe ten years, the beer parlors used to be segregated, and men, alone, sat on one side, and women, alone, and women would be the escorts sat on the other side and you had to enter the beer parlor from different doors, one of which was marked ""Men"", and the other was ""Ladies and Escorts"". The men's side also used to have, in some of the beer parlors, used to have a wooden floor covered with sawdust, which was simply easier to keep clean because of course when expected, there were constant brawls on the men's side and a lot of broken glass and spilled beer, I suppose that was the rationale. This is dedicated to the Alcazar, Cecil, Belmont, [New Fountain (?)] [audience laughter].

About Vancouver's fire, in 1868? 1886. There are a lot of quotes in here, and I think all of them, yes all of them are taken from a historical journal put out by the city archives and the body of it is concerned with W.H. Gallagher's eye-witness account. He was in a little office and had control of payroll for men who were working for the CPR clearing the land, the fire was caused by the clearing of the land, because the trees were knocked down bowling-pin method, that is a tree, a very large tree was chosen and then cut so that it would bring down a pile of trees as it fell and then the stuff was left because they didn't get around to burning it. And it was left over the summer, and got as dry as tinder. Not only that, but they were using gunpowder to blow up stumps.

And so it's compounded with memories of old Second Narrows Bridge, which has a lift-span that rises and all kinds of warning signs--it used to be that when you were learning to drive you went down to Second Narrows Bridge and boy if you made that bridge, you could pass the test.

This is also a skid row poem, it's a combination of present and past, Water Street, which is a block below Cordova, where there used to be a couple of very popular beer parlours, before they were closed down, Water, the other side of Water, used to be the shore line, that is, the harbour came right up to Water street, and houses, the first houses were built on the southern side of Water. That's where Gassy Jack Deighton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720322] built his saloon, the first saloon in Vancouver. That's how Vancouver got its original name, Gastown [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1495636], because this man was an eternal talker apparently. I use a word that's very foreign to me here, Leman, which means like his woman, and is a word that Alan Morley uses in his book about Vancouver and which I think captures the feeling of Gastown with all its small town morality and prudery.

Welcome to at last the second reading in the series, for this year.  As you probably know, the series that we have, it might be loosely called a kind of an avant-garde series, and in the, this is our fifth year, and this is the first time we've ever had anybody from the New York School [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1972942]--it's not going to be the last time, we're going to have Kenneth Koch [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2708628] in the spring, and we're looking for Tom Clarke [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7815337] next fall. Berrigan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2399732] is I guess now, one of the, say the halfback, I supposed, or quarterback of the New York School. Many of you have probably seen...[laughter] yeah, linebacker! When you ask when you're a little thin... And most of you have probably seen the propaganda sheet that's been around, downstairs and so on, and so you've heard the words that some of his confreres have said about him. I'd just like to add a little bit, in addition to those earlier books such as The Sonnets, and Bean Spasms, there's a couple of new books that have just appeared, one's called In the Early Morning Rain, which will be available here because it's a Cape Goliard book, and it's distributed in Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] by one of the big Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172] publishers, and another one with a Kraut title that I can't read that's bilingual, half-German and half-English that I'm sure we'll hear some from....

It's called ""Heroin"" I read this in high schools in Ann Arbor [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q485172] which I went to read in a program called Poetry Ann Arbor, and I wanted, I read the title and then I wanted to, I read the title and then I wanted to, I found it real funny because it was called ""Heroin,"" and I wanted to disclaim that it was a pro-heroin poem. So I said, this poem is not a pro-heroin poem.Then I realized there wasn't an anti-heroin poem either.  So I ended them, it was just sort of an on-heroin poem. [Audience laughter].

The title doesn't have too much to do with the poem, except that it sort of states something that Frank O'Hara evidently had to say, and so it says something that I have to say too in my own way, not that I have to say it the same way that Frank did.

I've always liked that poem. [Laughter]. All of those are written around 1962, 61 and 62.  I want to skip up to around 1967. I wrote this poem called ""Things to do in New York City"". I was leaving New York, and this poem, like many of my poems, was written for a specific occasion. It was for someone's birthday. And the poem, it's just my poem, it's not about the other person's birthday, it's just a present for him on his birthday.

I want to move around a little and not do exactly what I said. This is a poem I wrote last summer in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84], it's dedicated to the poet Tom Raworth [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7817338] and his wife. They lived in Colchester [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184163], which is an hour or two train-ride from London, and I was supposed to go down and see them, and I didn't go. And by way of apologies, I wrote this poem to Tom and to his wife, Val.

All the poems I'm going to read in this set are from my book, In the Early Morning Rain.  The title of this book I got from Gordon Lightfoot [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q359552], the Canadian folk singer-songwriter, and I didn't know, I made, I decided to use that title before Bobby Dylan's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q392] album Self-Portrait [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q634569] came out, so I didn't know that Bobby was going to record this song. I would have used it anyway, I'm sure. But, I mean if Dylan can steal it, I can steal it. And this book is a collection of poems of mine from over the last ten years, and I'm just going to read around in it. I wrote a lot of different kind of poems. I don't very often try for...I mean, I just take my poems where they come. This poem is called ""Hello"".

Now I'm going to read two or three poems that are from a section of this book called ""Life of a Man"".  ""Life of a Man"" is a book of poems in Italian by an Italian poet, a very great Italian poet who died not too long ago called Giuseppe Ungaretti [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311802]. There's a little story behind these. A lady poet named Barbara Guest [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q807448] once asked my friend Ron Patchett and I, would we translate some of Ungaretti's poems, because Ungaretti was coming to America [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30]. And she thought it would be nice if we would translate them as a sort of homage to him. And so I told her, I said, “Barbara, but we don't understand Italian,” and she said, “Oh, I'm sure you can do it, you two are marvelous”.  And she said, “Just get a dictionary, and you can look up the words”. So I looked at Ron and he looked at me, and we said, yeah, we can translate 'em, sure, but we don't want to get any dictionaries. So we just translated 'em without any dictionaries. [Audience laughter]. And we never showed them to Ungaretti but we showed them to Barbara Guest and she had the horrors. The first one is called ""Matinee"".

This next work is a translation too and it's a translation I did from French, which I understand some. And so this time I only had to leave certain words. This time I translated a lot of it accurately. But it's called ""Life among the woods"". And it's a translation of a page from a grammar book, some kind of book written in the French language. After I'd gotten this much done I decided it was over. Anyway, it's called ""Life Among the Woods"".

It starts at a poetry reading in Ann Arbor, but it's really about being in Ann Arbor and realizing I was leaving soon, and thinking about all the things that wouldn't happen to me again, because this trip was going to be over.  Even though, I'm--it's not all that sentimental, I mean I knew I might go to Ann Arbor again and all that, it was just that this particular trip was going to be over.

Introducer
00:00:02
I was going to talk on about Dorothy Livesay's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1250325] distinguished career, as a poet, and a critic and a teacher, but after what she told me tonight, I'm not sure if distinguished is exactly the right word, she says that at the age of nineteen, she snubbed the Prince of Wales [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q590227]. Nevertheless, two books should be mentioned, her selected and uncollected poems to appear this September and a book which was called 39 Women Poets which has gained another poet and another title at the last moment and as 40 Women Poets of Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] is now on sale outside, as you may have seen as you came in. Back in 1965, I guess it was, Wynne Francis managed to catch Dorothy Livesay as she was passing through Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340], and Dorothy gave a really private reading in Wynne's office. Ever since then, we have been trying to convince her to come back and read to us all in the series. I'm extremely happy this year that we have been successful and that I can present to you Dorothy Livesay.

00:01:58
I think I might get hung up on this, I had quite a disastrous time getting here. I arrived with a new poem of seven, whose title is ""Disasters of the Sun"", and my first disaster was on the train, sitting on top of my glasses, which are now somewhat myopic, and second disaster going to Sherbrooke [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q139473], the bus rolled right into an oil tanker, which somehow or other didn't blow up, but gashed my thumb, and at Bishop's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3551383] I had only begun to read when a fire alarm started [laughter], and rang for ten minutes before they silenced it. So I have a feeling that somehow or other, there are more disasters ahead tonight. However, I'm supposed to read a while and then call an intermission I think. Mostly I like to sort of go back over the years and trace the different things, especially love poems from early times on, but I'm going to skip about a bit. Recently in Edmonton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2096] I edited the fourth issue of a quarterly magazine, White Pelican. Which Sheila Watson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7493167] edits but she gave this particular issue to me, and I chose the theme of North. Feeling perhaps that we are still trying to find our identity, whether we're English Canadians or French Canadians, and that perhaps the north has some element of it in it which helps us to find that. I discovered though, in collecting material, stories, poems, plays about the north, that it was the Native Indian people who have a different view altogether of the north than we do. At the same time, you find many young Canadian poets identifying with Native culture, and almost feeling that they must become Native, and become Indian to be real, to know who they are. I wrote at the beginning of this issue this little note I'll just read. “North is from wherever you are looking.” It's starting...[laughter]. “For those living below the 49th parallel, Canada itself is North. In a sense, we're all here as explorers without a home. Our great guilt at having ousted the Native peoples from their land is now seeking expression in an attempt to re-create the Indian and Eskimo past, and every month brings forth books of poetry, fiction and history which seek to come to terms with pre-history, with myth, or with the way the Inuit live in harmony with nature. In ironic contrast, the Native artists and writers are expressing their concern, not with their past, but with possible ways of accommodation to the present, the white man's world. Thus, the three British Columbia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1974] Indian poets here represented, Skyros Bruce, Gordy Williams and Eleanor Crow are bitter, ironic and contemporary. Not for them the nostalgic recreation of the Indian myth, or even  not for them the vigorous folk humor of life in the north which you find in [unintelligible] and in later writers.” While I think it's worthwhile thinking about that because you do have a lot of young poets now seeping themselves in Indian or Eskimo culture, and feeling as if they must become that in order to be themselves. None of us can quite escape from this, and I have a poem or two that I'll begin with, which I suppose are my expression of coming to terms with the North, or the somewhat southernly north, Edmonton. I'll begin with a kind of collage poem where I put bits of history, bits of visual imagery and bits of surrealism together, called ""Edmonton Sweet"".

Quite a different poem about going North is called ""The Operation"", and that is the poem which is in this anthology, just out today, 40 Women Poets. I didn't intend to put myself in, but the other editors suggested it was the only 'done' thing to put one or two poems of my own in it. So here's the one called ""The Operation"". It's a kind of three-way poem where the woman is addressing the doctor and her lover, alternately, and then perhaps herself.

Since this anthology will probably be called a women's lib., even though it isn't, because none of the poets in it are consciously trying to be anything but their individual selves, nonetheless, I think there are poems by every woman which do express that individual point of view, that differentness, I have never been able, though perhaps I was a women's lib. creature in the thirties, I have never been able to feel that men and women are the same, and so I have poems, right through the years which illustrate that point of view. Here's a very recent one called ""The Woman Syndrome"".

And in a different vein altogether, the poem I suppose that's been the most anthologized of any of mine, which to me is a rather traditional way I suppose of seeing the male and female element. It's called ""Bartok and the Geranium"". The poem simply began because I was teaching an evening class of housewives the art of creative writing, and I gave them an assignment to write an imagistic or perhaps haiku-type poem, when they got home, to look at two objects, utterly different and disparate, and just see they could link these objects in a tension which would create a poem. Well the next day, I had sent the children to school after lunch and was sitting in the dining room listening to a CBC [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461761] concert, and heard music that I hadn't heard before at all, a violin concerto it seemed to be, and in the window as I was listening was this red geranium. So I thought to myself, well I've given my class an assignment, I wonder if I could do the same thing. And at the end of the concert they announced that it was Bela Bartok [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83326], violin concerto. So suddenly, the two elements, the music and the geranium, did seem to link in my mind and immediately I wrote the poem which I think I've never revised. I'll tell you afterwards about what some of the professors have said about the meaning of the poem.

Well, a few years later, Dr. Roy Daniels was giving a course in Canadian Literature, which I was a member, and one day he asked me if I would not come to class, so I divined he was going to deal with my poems, and I asked a fellow student to please take notes. So this was one of the poems he dealt with, and he informed the class that this poem represented the conflict between nature and art. While at first I was a bit dumbfounded, you know now about how the whole thing began and then what I felt about the he and she of it. But perhaps upon meditation, that this could be another meaning in the poem which I as poet, wasn't aware of but which was still perhaps there. But still another example of the different interpretations which people take to themselves and perhaps get great pleasure from, was, happened in U.N.B. [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1112515] when Fred Cogswell [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5494855] put this poem on a sight examination for a first year Canadian lit. class, and one of the students who I'm afraid failed his year, wrote on the paper, and on seeing this poem decided that it was written by a man, and he said it was about this guy Bartok who walked along the street and saw a whore leaning out of the window. Well on the same, and finally, this last one on the same kind of he and she of it, a poem written about a year ago, right out of a dream, I mean I dreamed this poem. It's called ""Latter Day Eve"".

...Polish immigrant who came back to the same house to pick up his belongings, and not knowing what was happening, entered the house, and police shot him in the back and killed him. This happened in Montreal in 1934 or 5. So out of all those experiences, through the thirties, and out of another year I had in New Jersey [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1408], living amongst the Negro, very, very discriminated against people in Englewood [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q986210], New Jersey. I, my whole poetry changed from being lyrical and personal to being social and yet I always, never felt it was something outside myself because I felt very powerfully the identification to what was happening to people. I returned from New Jersey about '36 and I wrote this poem which E.J. Pratt [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3045744] published in the first issue of the Canadian Poetry Magazine in ‘36. I guess I wrote it in about 1935. In it, there are various themes, the whole poem seemed to start from Cole Porter's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q215120] lines, the song we were all singing then, ""Night and Day"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1477068]. “Night and day, you are the one…” And then also there's a theme from Lennon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1203], who said ""In order to make two steps forward you may have to go one step back"". And this poem reverses that idea, in looking at industrial capitalist society. The other theme is that of the Negro and that of his exploitation and also of his release in song, and in Negro spiritual, because I did know them very well that year.

I might read one more poem from that period, ""Lorca"", and then perhaps you'd like a break. This is a little later, of course, this is about 1937-8, when the Spanish Civil War [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10859] was raging and haunted us very much in this country, many friends we knew joined the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1668887], and went to fight for Spain [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29]. At that time, we believed that the Spanish Court, Garcia Lorca [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41408], had been killed by Franco's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29179] men. I believe that, well in fact, Jack Spicer [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3805658] taught me that there's another version of his killing, that of a love triangle, but it didn't matter, the point was that many poets were fighting for Spain, and many were killed. So I'll just read ""Lorca"" if I can find it. Yes.

And though I don't want to appear to suit every taste, quite a lot of my poetry has been personal love poetry, beginning with the earliest days, my teenage, and I thought I would read a few very early love poems and then you could, you might be interested to compare them with those written within the last five or six years. These were from a book published in 1932, Signpost. And you'll notice that they're pretty well structured, and in a sense quite conventional, but perhaps they have a kind of feeling in them. ""Weapons"".

And a little poem called ""Give Us Our Trespasses"", which was an attempt to do what Jack Spicer had advised us at some of his sessions, to completely wipe out all sensation, all the senses and see what happened when the words came out of this void, out of this [unintelligible] and I did one poem about dreams dedicated to him, and then a little later, this other one came. One would listen in the dark for the words, but not expecting or unexpecting, you understand, but they would certainly arrive and I would turn on the light and write them down. And then turn off the light, turn to sleep again, but again, more words came, and so this series has about seven of these little interludes in it.

And perhaps relating it to our own history in this country. It's a more, I suppose, didactic poem. ""The Artefacts, West Coast"".

We have two readers tonight, both Canadian poets, as you know, and, but in most cases when we have two poets as we did last time, we generally have one poet read for a while, then have a break, and then have the other poet read for a while, but we're not going to do it that way tonight. We're just going to throw the thing open to both David McFadden [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5237344] and Gerry Gilbert [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5552756] and they will work it out as it seems to work out for them. This makes a lot of sense, although they've never read together before, they're both published by the same publishing house, and published in the same magazines and know each other as they used to say in the old days in the ivy league by reputation. Gerry Gilbert is, as a lot of people we've had this year, is from the West Coast and has been involved for quite a while with an outfit in the coast that gobbles up your tax money called Intermedia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39079179], that's why the screen is there, something might happen there occasionally. Gerry was at one time the editor of a seminal West Coast publishing venture called Radio Free Rain Forest, and is the author of a series of books and things that are like books, as for instance, White Lunch which came out several years ago in Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639] and Telephone Book which is published by Coach House Press, I think, no, Weed/Flower, sorry. David's also been published by Weed/Flower and the Coach House Press, and his forthcoming book is the second volume of the Big/Little Book novel, called The Great Canadian Sonnet with illustrations by a little-known London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q92561] artist named Greg Curnoe [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5605459]. His next book is going to be called Poems Worth Knowing, a title that anyone from Ontario [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904] or British Columbia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1974] will know. What we're going to do is they're going to operate for a little while, and then when they feel the need for a break there will be a short intermission, like about ten minutes, then we'll proceed again with what, as they say, the second set. So I'm not going to be able to say that somebody's reading first and somebody's reading second but what I will be able to say is that the readers will be David McFadden and Gerry Gilbert.

Most people will have seen, probably, the little promo sheet that went out about Kenneth [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2708628] talking about all his various books et cetera, so I'll keep this very short. Those that have been involved in reading American poetry over the past few years will naturally know who Kenneth Koch is, that he along with Frank O'Hara [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q951010] probably invented modern American poetry in New York City [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60], and it's, and he's also been in the news lately in the various, Slick magazine in the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] as a teacher of poetry, a very important teacher of poetry to kids in schools. And he's the only man I know who's been able to write what I think is probably an epic in the American language. So I'd like to make this as fast as I can and introduce Mr. Kenneth Koch.

The next poem I want to read is called ""Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams"". I love Williams' [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106] work, and I usually only write parodies of people whose work I like a lot. This parody is based on a poem of Williams, well, actually, on a certain characteristic I saw in Williams' work for a long time which I like, which is sort of, the idea that if you really like something enough and if you want to do it enough, it's okay to do it. And I saw certain insane possibilities of this viewpoint. This is specifically a parody of a poem which goes, ""This is just to say I've eaten the plums in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were so cold and so delicious"". It's really a nice poem, but it seemed to me there was a little streak of insanity running through it. It's called, ""Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams"".

I'm trying to find the ideal lights still, it’s--okay, I think that's probably a bit better. The next thing that I want to read is a play called ""E.KOLOGY"". It's...E.KOLOGY is the name of the hero, it's like capital ""E,"" period, capital ""KOLOGY."" I'd like to say something about this play. I read it at the University of Chicago [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131252] last year, and some students thought that I was making fun of the ecology movement. I'm not, and I would see to it that if it were produced that that was not the case. It just seemed to me that the ecology movement was such a, like a natural cause for pleasure that it wouldn't really do to be totally solemn about it. The, I wrote this to be performed on Earth Day [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124473], in New York last year in April, but they were supposed to have all these things in Union Square [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q110007] and it just ended up being a lot of light shows and speeches, I think, because they couldn't get the actors together and the lights and the stage and everything. It was done in Philadelphia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1345], did anyone see it, by any chance? Probably not. I didn't see it. I didn't even know it was done. In any case. E.KOLOGY.

This, the next thing I want to read is part of a long poem I've been writing in the last year. George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280] mentioned an epic poem I wrote called “Ko”, which I wrote about, oh twelve or fourteen years ago, and it's a poem...that's “Ko”, there it is, and it's about a hundred and twenty pages, it's in ottava rima, which is a stanza that Ariosto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48900] used in Orlando Furioso [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48922] and it's also the stanza that Byron [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5679] used in Don Juan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1245187]. It rhymes ABABABCC. And...I really like “Ko” a lot. It's a poem about a, the main character is a Japanese baseball player, a pitcher, who throws the ball so hard he knocks the grandstand down with every pitch. And there are a lot of other characters in it. When I wrote the poem I really was very happy, I was living in Florence [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2044], in a villino, and, sort of outside of town on the Viale Michelangelo, and what I tried to do in “Ko” is like to put in every pleasant thing I'd ever experienced in my life, and the poem is kind of happy and optimistic. And I always wanted to continue it, because I liked writing that way. And I never could, because the continuation was always sort of in the style of “Ko” exactly and not as good. It sort of lost that particular feeling. Then I finally was able to start doing it again, recently, but I noticed as I went on writing the poem that it had changed a good deal, that my idea about life and the world was not quite the same, naturally, partly because it changes in me, and partly because it changes in the world, but I don't want to get into metaphysical questions. In any case, the first thing I want to read from this poem is the, like the “Prologue”, which explains my problems in continuing this very happy poem fourteen years afterwards. The only, I think the only thing that needs explaining that I haven't explained is that “Ko” ends with the line, ""Huddle, meanwhile, was flaking at the knees."" Now Huddle is a, like an Englishman in “Ko” who dies of mold fever in Rome [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q220], and when he dies he turns into a statue which is set up near the Villa Giulia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q964499] in Rome. And all of the other characters that have been killed sort of turn into statues and start coming back to life, and this is a sign that Huddle is coming back to life but he's flaking at the knees. In any case, that's referred to at the beginning of the “Prologue”.

That's the end of the “Prologue”. I want to read the first episode in the poem, now. I realize there was another, perhaps incomprehensible thing in the “Prologue”. Pana Grady...Pana Grady's apartment was a place on...Central Park West [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2738041] where a lot of parties were held for Upper and Lower Bohemia in the days...well, it was about five or six years ago. Anyway. That's the end of the “Prologue”, which I'm not sure I'm finally going to attach to the poem, since I usually eliminate prologues. And this is the beginning of the poem.

That's the end of the first part. To tell you what happens in this poem would take as long as reading the whole poem, which I don't have time to do. I think I'd like to read some brief, improvisational plays. I wrote these plays to be done at The Living Theatre [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1202416], though I knew they wouldn't do them. Somebody asked me to write some improvisational plays, it's really, it's really great, you know, writes it with some actors that want to do it, and I'd, I'd seen some improvisational plays and it seemed to me that the only emotions that actors could improvise were...let's see, passion, nostalgia, self-hatred, anxiety, and then make narcissism and then make topical references, and I decide to really throw sort of a curve at actors and give them something that would really be hard to improvise. My penalty has been that these plays have never been done. The first one I'd like to read...I'd be very glad if they were, could be given a premiere here in Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16]. ""Mexico City"".

I think I'd like to read a rather long poem called...my present plan, which--I don't want to really ruin people's evening, since I didn't start until 9:30, I think the poems that I would like to read will last until 11. So, it's twenty-five after ten now, I don't want to keep anybody up to late or anything. [Audience laughter]. If...Don't feel bad about leaving if you have to go, I want to read these two rather long poems. This is called ""The Pleasures of Peace"". I should say something about this poem, I wrote it...I started to write it, oh, three years ago, or whenever it was, maybe it was four years ago, but it took me a long time to write it. I guess about three years ago I started. It was at the moment of the, when there really was a lot of happiness in the peace movement in the United States. And it was like the first Peace Marches on Fifth Avenue, and people were jumping up and down for peace, and dancing for peace, and it really seemed as though what people were doing was going to do some good. And I remember feeling very excited in the first set of mass peace activities I was in because, being a poet, and having been brought up in America and everything and like almost all the other poets and artists I knew I sort of felt like a social outcast a little bit. And then I found, in the midst of the peace movement, like there were hundreds of thousands of people who sort of felt the same way about a lot of things, it was nice. And there was something very sort of grand and exciting about the peace movement which does not have anything to do with the issues at all, it was just a lot of fun. In a way it was sort of...it was very pleasant. There were a few other things that motivated this poem. One was I was very annoyed at a lot of my fellow-poets who were going around, giving, in groups to colleges, giving poetry readings for peace. Now there were two things about this that annoyed me, three things. One was that I wasn't doing it. But that, I think, was a minor thing  A second thing was that...who did they really think they were trying to convert, like college students who came to poetry readings? I mean, college students who come to poetry readings are not usually in favour of war. And in the second-place, all the poems they read for peace were the sort of things that would make you want to go out and kill people, like ""Lyndon Johnson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9640], you, fuck the pregnant woman who's lying with her guts streaming out,"" [audience laughter] and they weren't, they didn't really...they didn't really seem like peace poems to me. It...And I felt it was sort of exploitative on their part to do that. So I wanted to write a--I'd never written a political poem and I wanted very much to write a poem, I had very strong feelings about the Vietnam War [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8740], and I wanted to write a poem against the war but which really, was really a poem, a positive poem about peace. I found it terribly hard to do, and I never worked so long on any poem. The fact that I worked so long on it does not mean that it's any better than anything else I ever wrote, but it was just hard, because I kept trying to put in sort of, things about suffering and so on, and they would jump out of the poem the way an artificial heart, I mean the way a transferred heart is sometimes rejected by the body. And I realized I was sort of stuck with writing a poem that was, like, one of my poems, it was really sort of a positive poem about peace. Another problem is that if you write a poem about the pleasures of peace it means you're writing a poem about the pleasures of life. And it's endless, in any case. That's about enough of that for now. It took me over a year to write, it was mainly the last part I couldn't write, since I didn't want to have sort of a literary copout at the end, and I didn't want to sort of end up, oh well, anyway. It's just a poem. The only thing--I got varied reactions to the poem. One...some dopey poet friend of mine came over and said, ""Boy, you really put the peace movement down"". And I haven't spoken to him very much since then. But then, a better reaction was that I got, some guy called me up and asked me if he could use this poem as his draft resistance statement. And I said you're going to languish in prison for a long time because, you know, judges don't like poetry. But anyway. Now just forget everything I've said [audience laughter] and I'll read this poem. And there's a pause. ""The Pleasures of Peace"". Oh! Another thing. [Audience laughter]. I read this poem in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84] last year, and I got this dopey review in the Times [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50008] by, who was it....I'm not sure. And he said, ""Kenneth Koch's 'Pleasures of Peace' is a very interesting poem but since he mentions the name of all his friends which we can't be expected to know”--like about 90% of the people in this poem are imaginary. They, they're not my friends. [Audience laughter]. Okay. Like Georgio Finogo is not a real person, okay?. ""The Pleasures of Peace"".

Probably some of us are here in order to look at or touch the Gary Snyder [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315963] who actually went and did all those semi-mythological things, who has climbed mountains and traveled in India with Allen Ginsberg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711], who provided Kerouac [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q160534] with a book character, who has lived in or on the edges of several different kinds of wilderness, who has lived in the precincts of Japanese Buddhist monasteries, who has fought, I think has fought hard, to keep other cultures than ours, and other kinds of life than human life, from obliteration. And who has written poems out of the consciousness of these things. For myself, Gary Snyder hasn't made poems so much as he has provided me with windows made out of words. These are windows that have had a way of, themselves disappearing, leaving me usually standing where I think I want to be, out in the open world. So, I came here, I've come here, to meet whoever it is that makes so many good windows. I'll let you discover for yourselves how much this window-maker is what a windowmaker should be, himself, just open and clear. I'd like to present Gary Snyder.

Gary Snyder
00:02:58
I forgot one more thing I wanted to have out here. Good evening. I'm going to read in two sets this evening, with a little intermission. And first of all, I'm not going to read any poems tonight from my published books, because those poems are available and what is interesting to me is always what I'm doing, where I'm moving. So I'm going to read from a cycle of short poems, moderately short poems, which I call ""Charms"", and
then there'll be a break, and then I'm going to read recent sections that I've been working on from a long poem in progress called ""Mountains and Rivers Without End"". I came back to the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] from Japan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17] with my wife and children about three years ago now, and went as rapidly as possible to settle in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26777], on the north slope of the south fork of the Yuba river [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q181973] at three-thousand foot elevation. And I've been living there for almost two years now. I'm saying this by way of introduction to this first cycle of poems called ""Charms"". I was brought up on a farm, and all of my ancestors that I know of, for the last few generations on both sides, were rural people, or miners, miners in Colorado [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1261], Leadville [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q286702], places like that. And it amazes me in a mysterious way how to get back to doing what my father was doing when I was a little boy, and what, and which I remember as a little boy, and to get back to doing what my grandfather was doing, which is to say--again, looking at the fences, looking at the stumps, looking at the house, looking at the well, looking at the spring and saying, how are we going to do it--touches me more deeply than I can possibly explain. And at the same time, being confronted again with these choices, which are the choices of the American frontier, and also the choices of medieval Europeans, and neolithic Mediterranean people, and neolithic Japanese people, and neolithic Chinese people. With what I've come to understand, a little more now, about history, anthropology, and biology, I feel an extraordinary responsibility to understand why I make the choices I make, in such matters as, where does one break the ground and locate a garden, or which trees does one select to fall. In other words, I find myself again in that position of entering virgin land, and this time, I want to understand, in the process of making my own choices, I want to understand why we did it wrong, every time before, and hope to get some insights in how one goes about doing it right, this time. In moving toward that understanding, in making the choices that I have to make, about how we are going to live, in the semi-wilderness and true wilderness of the Sierra Nevada, my teachers have to be scientific foresters, biologists and ecologists on the one hand, and the American Indians on the other. There are no other teachers available for these choices.

Gary Snyder
00:08:02
And so these poems, in the cycle called ""Charms"", reflect those debts and reflect the search for that knowledge, insofar as I've gotten into it up to this point. It starts with a little chant, called ""Grace for Love"". Before we...grace, in the sense of the grace that we say before meals. Which is, grace is gratitude, an expression of gratitude for a meal. And the gratitude that we say at my rancheria is a kind of a rough translation from a Japanese Buddhist grace which goes like this in English: ""We venerate the three treasures and are thankful for this meal, the work of other people, and the suffering of other forms of life."" The need for grace, for love, is something I became aware of when I realized that there was a level of validity in the Catholic Church's objection to contraceptive devices, insofar as love, like food, is a sacrament, and that there is level in which the act of love should inevitably be connected with the consciousness of its role in moving the seed, in transmitting the energy of the knowledge of the biomass, as transmitted down through time. But I felt that the church is far too simple-minded in assuming that the energy aroused in the sacrament of love, in the direction of fertility, has to mean literally that the people who are acting that sacrament out have to necessarily procreate their own kind. And so we came to this, I and several other people, came to this, as what primitive people would call the transferral of merit, or species-increase ritual. In other words, we make love with gratitude to other beings, and wish to transfer our fertility from the human race to the vanishing species.

The Navajo word ""Anasazi"" means ""the ancient ones."" It's the name that the Navajo gave to the people who lived in the canyons and cliffs of Chaco Canyon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49786970] and Canyon De Chelly [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41679118] and Mesa Verde [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6821095] and many other sites. Probably the people were the ancestors of the present Pueblo people, living there probably up until the twelfth century, till the great drought of the thirteenth century. The people who more than any others, to judge from what the Pueblo people are still able to transmit today, the people who more than any others have achieved what could truly be called ""civilization"" on this continent, and whose lore embodies perhaps two millennia of deep experience. I wrote this at Canyon De Chelly.

The Canyon De Chelly, which will come up in another poem I'm going to read later today, and in fact, all over the West, all over the Great Basin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q966943], and in other parts of North America [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49] too, notably on the granite outcroppings on th]e northern shores of Lake Superior [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1066], for example, are designs pecked into the rocks, petroglyphs. Anthropologists, Americanists, whatever you call 'em, haven't had much time to study those petroglyphs yet, because they've been engaged through all the years of this century in a hasty, half-successful salvage operation. Salvaging the remnants of this or that dying culture, recording and taping the last words of a dying language, and they've had no time to give to studying these older things that they know are there, such as the petroglyphs. But the petroglyphs have a repeated vocabulary of motifs which are found in patterns distributed all over North America, and particularly in the West. One of the most widespread is a hand, that someone has put on a cliff or a boulder face, apparently outlined, and then filled it in with red, hematite, or a red hand. That red hand often is lacking a finger, or lacking a finger-joint. This would not be notable in itself if it weren't that in the caves of southern France [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q142] and northern Spain [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29], there are dated, back as far as 40,000 years, the same red hands, with missing fingers and missing finger-joints are found. This is only one of a number of things which are found all the way. And so this next poem, ""The Way West Underground"", is one of a number of poems, and this is perhaps the most intellectual of them, in which I'm trying to trace out how you get back to make the line of connection between what I know the American knows, what I am beginning to know the American Indian knew, and what I am beginning to know our prehistoric ancestors knew, which was not a different knowledge. And the question of why our prehistoric ancestors lost it is another question. Actually the main impetus of this poem deals with the bears, because there's an international mystery religion called the Bear Cult, that runs all the way from Finland [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33] to Utah [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q829], across Siberia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5428], and it shares the mysterious central theme, which is a girl who marries a bear. I've written several poems about that girl. And about the bears. And so this is coming in on that from another angle.

So I had to trace back again in my mind, with my eyes, with my observation: of course, the plants produce seeds, the birds feed on the seeds, and so forth. Small members of the food chain. The ocean is similar but in a different set of relationships. We live on an exuberance of sexuality. We eat the reproductive organs of grasses: wheat, rice. Because herring or cod have millions of eggs that hatch into millions of almost-microscopic fry, the food chains of the ocean are made possible.

I read that because it goes so nicely with this other poem, called ""Song to the Raw Material"". I really think a lot about these things these days because I've put myself deliberately in the position of having to know where my food comes from, and it's no longer a question of, like do I eat natural foods or supermarket foods, or do I eat meat or am I a vegetarian, it's more sophisticated than that, it's a lot more subtle than that. Like literally, where did it come from. And by what means can I have a sense of responsibility and gratitude to what it is that I'm eating and in what sense can I repay that world, whichever world it is, that I am feeding off of. Well of course one way you can repay it is by being a willing, and gracious, member of the food chain yourself. Now we are rather large animals, which means that we are rather high in the food chain. But nonetheless, quite edible. And it would be a great honour, really, to be eaten by a large, rare predator, and I can't think of any way I'd rather finish my days than to give myself to a grizzly bear, if I could, you know, choose when. [Laughter]. Like get all my affairs in order first. I'm not ready yet! Or at least, go back, as large creatures often do, go back into the cycle of feeding smaller creatures. But you can see the basic biological ignorance of this society, the ignorance of what systems really are, what basic systems are, and what our responsibilities to our membership in basic systems is, by the fact that they either burn people up or they fill them full of chemicals which make them not tasty, and lock them in bronze caskets, and so forth. The only people in the world who are righteous about this particular question seem to be the Tibetans and the Parsis, I mean, really righteous about it. The Tibetans and the Parsis have an old tradition, which is mentioned, it's so old that it's mentioned by Herodotus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11925546], in talking about a group of people called the Magi, in Persia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q794], that is to say they expose their dead in elevated places and feed them to the vultures. That's one very elegant way, actually, to deal with it. The Eskimo, an Eskimo shaman whose name I forget, is reputed to have said, ""We live dangerous lives, because our food consists entirely of souls"". “Song to the Raw Material”.

""The Bath"". Where we live we don't have any electricity or propane, and so we do everything with wood, including heating our bath, which we found the best wood-fired bathing system was a Finnish-type sauna, and...so this poem, you know just to set the scene, it's a somewhat longer poem, this poem is a sauna, with a wood-burning stove that also heats a tank of water on the side, and with a bench that you sit up on and a lower place that you can get down on and wash with. You can get these wood-fired sauna-stoves from some Finnish outfit in Michigan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1166]. The only place in the United States that I have been able to locate that makes sauna stoves that fire wood. I highly recommend them.

That poem is not an exaggeration of what we're doing. We are, like, where I am and a number of other people I know around this continent, have their backs up against the wilderness, so to speak, and they're not going to let this thing go past them. If they can help it, or as you say, over my dead body. The California Indians used to set control burns, as distinct from wildfires, forestry terms, which contributed to the maintenance of what you might call a climax timber stand, keeping the undergrowth burnt out, keeping an annual deer-forage coming in, and protecting the large timber, as it were, from destructive forest fires, because whenever a forest fire--which is very common in California [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99], it's an annual event--whenever forest fires go through, went through the forests when they were in that condition, it simply went through taking the ground cover off, but couldn't get hot enough or high enough to kill the large trees. With the advent of logging, mining, and the Manzanita brush that follows on that, the whole flora of California changed radically. All of the flora of California changed. What happened was that the woods got very brushy, and then the early forestry practices which were, of course, to put forest fires out whenever they came on them, in some ways contributed to the increasingly dangerous situation of dense brush, logging slash laying around, second-growth trees not really very large yet, and a situation where every brush fire that went through killed absolutely everything grew up. And that's the state of the state now, to a large extent, although there are some hip foresters now who are back into control burns as best as they can. This poem is called ""Control Burn"" and it only starts from what I'm just talking about, taking that as an image.

In the poem ""Charms"", which is dedicated to Michael McClure [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1390054], who has more than any other living poet, or person even that I know, has gone farther than anyone else, I think, into becoming one with, in understanding, in penetrating, in perceiving the consciousness of other beings.

Do you remember getting tiny toys for your children from San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62]? There was a small book that I saw in the States, folded out in a certain, section-by-section, parts of the earth kinda, growing larger and larger and larger...

Well, there has been a great deal of opposition to nuclear energy, and nuclear power-generating stations, in the United States so effective in some areas that a lot of generating plants have been blocked or slowed down in their construction. And I think that the United States government is about to launch on an enormous effort to calm the public and to lull it into accepting massive developments of nuclear energy generating centres, fast-breeder and later, perhaps, fusion. Now I myself would have no objection to such a thing if I could be convinced that it was safe, both in the long term and the short term, and although it might be conceivably safe in the short term, I can see no way in which it would be safe in the long run, because nuclear wastes accumulated over, say, several centuries, as they might be, or more, in increasing quantities around the globe, are going to out eventually, and even though you can say, well, we're putting it off for five hundred thousand years, five hundred thousand years is not a very long time.  And if we are feeding a wasteful, industrial, technological, consumer society for a few more centuries, buying it a few more centuries of life, at the expense of all future biological health on the planet, it's obviously not worth it. The Amchitka test, which is possibly interested in such things as what uses very large explosions would have in releasing oil from oil-bearing shale or something like that, I think the U.S. administration is going ahead with this test in the face of all this criticism, deliberately, as a deliberate and very intelligent gamble. The chances are that nothing will happen. When nothing happens, then they will be able to say, ""All you people were hysterical. You see?  Nothing happened"".  And that will buy them a lot of time and a lot of credibility to proceed strongly and forcibly with more nuclear testing and more nuclear power generation development. And the conservationists, perhaps, have in a way, played into their hands, by making such a big issue out of it, so that they will be left holding an empty bag if nothing happens. If something does happen, then the administration can say, ""You're right, we were wrong"", and Nixon [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588] perhaps forfeits the next election. That's all. Okay.

""Mountains and Rivers Without End"" is a poem that I've been working on, it's a long poem, a long series of interconnected long poems that I've been working on for some years. I'm going to read several sections from that tonight. Including one or two that are very recent, in fact these are all pretty recent. ""Mountains and Rivers without End"". The title of the poem comes from a Yuan Dynasty [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7313] Chinese scroll, that unfolds sideways and is thirty-five feet long. By way of introduction, a little poem called ""The Rabbit"". There are many sections to this, I'm only going to read [counts under breath.]..six tonight.

""The California Water Plan"". The state of California at the moment is engaged in a large, incredibly wasteful, incredibly stupid, illegal, even by their own terms, water plan project, which if they're lucky, will salinate the Sacramento Valley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1686914] and make agriculture permanently impossible. I was up in the Minarets [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2412852] in the Sierra last summer, thinking about the California Water Plan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28228216], and I perceived something of what the true California Water Plan was. So I wrote this down. It refers to an obscure little Buddhist god called Fudo, or Achala [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q337624], who is my particular guardian, my personal guardian and my personal teacher, and, so I use, I refer to him, in several poems. The other two poems in which I refer to him actually are a piece called ""Smokey the Bear Sutra"", and another piece called ""Spell Against Demons"". This is the final, actually, this is the third and final poem in the trilogy of Fudo poems. Also. But you'll find all about Fudo in this poem, it'll drive you crazy.

Now, the rest of these poems that I'm going to read this evening are cutting back and forth between ancient India [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q668] and ancient North America. I--living as I do and where I have lived all my life, we face the Pacific [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q98]. And, the American Indian came from Asia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48], or vice versa, the Asians came from North America. I mean I know a Shoshone who says that. He says, ""We've always been here, those Asians came from here"". [Laughter].  ""What do you mean we came from someplace else, that's some white anthropologist theory"". [Laughter]. ""Kumarajiva's Mother."" Kumarajiva [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q335293] was a great Buddhist monk-scholar-translator, who was kidnapped by the Chinese from Central Asia, by force, and carried off to China [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q148] where he was made to translate Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Chinese, and he stayed there the rest of his life, with a crew of about eighty Chinese assistants, day and night, translating sutras. He did a lot of translation. He also got in trouble, because he liked girls, and on one occasion, because he actually had mistresses apparently, he ate a bowl of needles, like you sew with needles, in front of an assembly of all the monks and assistants in Peking [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q956], or no it wasn't Peking in those days, it was Chang'an [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6501000], all of the monks and assistants in the capital, Chang'an, and then he said, ""When you boys can eat needles, you can have girlfriends too"". [Audience laughter]. But this poem is about his mother. [Audience laughter]. And I really, I mean I could explain to you why I wrote this poem but it isn't really worth explaining, I'll just read it. It has to do partly with the fact that my mother has freckles. And I was trying to figure out at this time, when I wrote this, I was trying to figure out whatever happened to women in Buddhism? Like something happened to 'em. They got lost. For a long time, anyway.

...alone in the 8th century, and studied at an enormous Buddhist, Mahayana university called Nalanda [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216243], for fifteen years, and then walked back to China, with a fraying pack full of books, which he translated for the next twenty years after he got back to China. He brought the school of Buddhism, which is called the school of Mind Only, and the school of Emptiness. That's one aspect of this next poem. Another aspect is a little petroglyph, American Indian petroglyph figure, called the hump-backed flute player, a little stick figure playing the flute, with a pack on his back, walking. He was found pecked on the rocks from Sonora [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46422], Mexico [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96] up into the Great Basin, and about which almost nothing is known. The Ghost Dance, which was a Messianic Indian religion, started by a Paiute named Wovoka https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q558420], which asserted that perhaps by magic the white man could be swept away from North America and the game would return.  And finally, the oldest living beings are the bristle-coned pine, who live in the White Mountains [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1556007], at an elevation of nine thousand feet in eastern California, the oldest of which is something like four thousand five hundred years old. So this poem is called ""The Humpbacked Flute Player"".

Some of the phonemes on the ends of words are prolonged, and others are stuttered. I'm not sure that any of them that are stuttered are in this particular batch. I wrote about 500 of these in late 1961, early--late, let's see, late ‘60 and early ‘61.

This is a, a number of these are collages of various times and places, as well as spontaneity in this room here, on two of these tapes, you will hear a lady's voice along with my own. I did a concert of my works along with Jim Tenney [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q715379] and Max Neuhaus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2182711], in town hall, New York in September of 1966, and still earlier Max Neuhaus had realized this particular piece which is a piece produced by subjecting the electric typewriter keyboard to randomization by random numbers, so it looks like a lot of different characters from the electric typewriter, Neuhaus recorded it at the University of Illinois [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1145814] laboratory, I guess some time earlier in ‘66 or maybe ‘65 and then put it down four octaves. He and another guy were reading from--the readers read from this in any way they wish, now I'll have the live readers to come up here...So then in... in this ‘66 concert, I did it as a duet, reading through the negatives from which this was printed, the blinking light, and a Jeanne Lee [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q274580], a very fine blues singer was in the various works that were performed in that concert, and she's on the duet that you hear, that you will hear. A year ago, or a little more, I guess in April of last year I performed this in a class at NYU [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49210] along with the-oh and the Neuhaus tape was along with that performance in NYU, then the town hall performance and the Neuhaus tape--all three were in the NYU performance along with the NYU performance, so now you'll hear it at least four different times, plus the present, something like that.

I'll do a piece called ""Fifth Gatha'', which is another group piece, uh, the readers who learned it, please come up with copies, and I'll have to toss around tapes for a few minutes here. I might explain that this particular piece is one of a series I call ""Gathas"" that are written on graphed paper, they by chance operations. I take the mantra of one religion or another, this happens to be the great prajnaparamita mantra, which is basic to Northern Buddhism and Zen Buddhism, and it's arranged by the method so that it falls over an axis of 'a's, 'u's and 'm's that is the word 'aum', wherever a's, u's and m's appear in the mantra they may cross the mantra, there aren't many u's in this particular one, so there isn't any--nothing crossing the u-line, you may be able to see the empty gap there. The mantra in question is ""Gone, gone to the other shore, quite gone over the other shore, boldly, wisdom, spaha, pray. Guthe, guthe, paraguthe [unintelligible]..."" you may, those of you who know zen may be more familiar with it in its Japanese version, which is sort of a Japanization of the Sanskrit. The group version of it was done in the Chelsea Hotel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q240711], I think in '67, but the German editor and producer, Carl Weissner [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1040995], the whisper version you hear, I did at home, earlier, maybe in ‘66, ‘65, ‘66.

The last poem I read was also from Stanzas for Iris Lezak. It's based on the Tibetan prayer to the gurus and it's translated by W.Y. Evans-Wentz [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q456451]. The next piece is all about bluebirds. It’s again--it uses the form of...In recent years I've gone back to writing poems in the form of the asymmetries that I wrote in ‘60 and ‘61, but these tended to cluster around one subject matter. There's one in the current Aspen Magazine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4807826] about young turtles, no one really knows where they go once they've hatched, and they know when they come back, but they don't really know what they do in between hatching and there is a natural history magazine, there was a caption to a picture, and so there was a record in the current Aspen, that's of that group. This is the first one of this type that I did on bluebirds, was for a group event that a number of us, let’s see, Iris Lezak, Emmett Williams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q719185], Carol [Bouget (?)] and [Jet Yalka (?)] and I did a collective event for the University of Syracuse [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q617433] at Utica [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2495519], which we called, which Emmett named for us [""Jack-a-Jurismatics (?)”] and so one of the pieces I wrote for that was this bluebirds piece. Emmett Williams has a beautiful work that has bluebirds in it, it's a permutation poem that also appears in this anthology, although this is an anthology that La Monte Young [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q432822] got together in ‘60 and we--‘60 and ‘61 I guess, and he had many difficulties between the time that it was designed and the time it was printed and finally got it out at first in 1963, it's called An Anthology of--well, various things--Chance Operations, and well I don't know what, concept art, anti-art, indeterminacy improvisation, meaningless work, natural disasters and so on. And well, just recently, our first edition is now a sort of a collector's item, sells around a hundred, but recently a German publisher re-published it for us and the current, the new editions is going for $8.50, so if anyone is--I don't have copies here but I'll be happy to send any to anybody. Contains work mostly, a lot of it is music, musical scores, there's some other poetry, including the Emmett Williams mention. The Emmett Williams poem does all the variations, does all the permutations of one group of things, ""somewhere bluebirds are flying high in the sky, in the cellar even blackbirds are extinct"", each of those is considered a run unit, and all the possible permutations of them are written out ""somewhere bluebirds are flying high in the sky, in the cellar even blackbirds are extinct"". I'd love to read it, but it's very long. Usually we read it with five different voices, each taking the unit and once in a while, people get through it without breaking down laughing. [Unintelligible]. This was taken from, the bluebird asymmetries were from two...were from two encyclopedia articles on bluebirds, one I think the Audubon Encyclopedia, and I've forgotten what the other one was. They're very complimentary. The voices you hear are, you heard in another performance of Leslie [Sixfin (?)], Amy [Spurling (?)] and Harvey [Lesain (?)], along with four of my students at the Mannes School of Music [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1519151] and about done in 1966, or 1967, I think it was May of 1967 that this was done. There's a specially gifted group I felt that I happened to get together in that class, just towards the end we were doing mostly, we were just doing ordinary grammar English, I'm an English teacher, for my bread.

This is the one you wanted some light percussive stuff?

Jackson Mac Low
00:00:04
Yeah, but very easy on it, not very, you know, keep the amplitude down to, no higher than mezzo piano. Did someone take one from here? I'm supposed to have one and ten. Try to start with the earlier ones and then go into the later ones if possible. Those with the first, the earlier numbers should be on mic first. Those with numbers between two and five I guess you would have. So that the [unintelligible] will hear the earlier ones more than the later ones. You can prolong any of the phonemes at the ends of lines. This is another piece called [unintelligible].

I have one last one that none of these people have yet seen, and so this one has no rules, that is, the others have some rules for how you put in silences, these will, these...In the summer of ‘69 I did a project for the Los Angeles Museum of Art [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1641836], an art technology show that's going to open this May. Unfortunately, my machine was bombed out, the corporation seems to be on the rocks, they're not providing the machine, but luckily I had poems that appeared on cathode ray tubes or something called a programmable film reader, and the words appear at the same time we sent the same impulses through an audio system and they turned out to be, well the oboe family, everything down from sopranino oboe to double, double, double bass oboe according to how long the lines were and so I did quite a few poems, this particular one is ""The"", and it's the last one I did, and tried to grab I guess three pages each, just use whatever discretion you want to, and listen, listen, listen. Earlier I had very strict rules governed by chance operations and so on, in reading these, well, in reading these kind of simultaneous works, and more and more I came to the, well I always had the principal of the most important things was to listen hard to everything that was happening, including whatever was happening in the room, whatever’s happening outside and so on, but more and more I relied on the readers to judge when to come in, and in--perform--these I found, this is one very long print-out of this particular poem. I don't want to--I think in, I don't remember, someplace there's a description of the idea of how they were made and all that, but what I got was a number of messages that, of which the units were permuted, the earliest form of my program was simply permuting the words in each, single words in each message. Later on I was able to get carriage returns and things like that so that in this, each message is a group of short sentences, usually about the same thing, and you'll, so that on the page each message looks like a sort of a stanza or strophe, and the groups of sentences--any number of the groups of sentences from any one of these strophe units may appear at any time according to way the thing is programmed. Does everybody have about three pages? Let's just make it...

A short quotation which appears in the Contributors' Notes to Paul Carroll's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15459057] anthology The Young American Poets. Quote: “As far back as I can remember there was a kind of dumbness within me, a need that sought expression. How it eventually materialized in the act of writing a poem belongs to a biography which I have only been able to recount in a few successful poems. As for the finished product, the poem, my need requires it to be of, as Whitman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81438] said, the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, and further, if they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing, or next to nothing. On a subjective level, I write to give being to that vibration which is my life, and to survive in a hard time”. Charles Simic [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q722555].

I realized that I hadn't seen a tree or an animal in about three or four years, and yet at the same time writing, you know, occasionally about some cows, or, you know, and I was saying, what are these animals, you know, these shadowy animals.

This is a very different kind of poem. The material for the the poem is, are, cliches, working with, with awful cliches, things which were totally beaten to death and, you know, can't be used anymore. Or proverbs, popular wisdom, and I'm twisting it all around, trying to reverse the kind of universe that is implied by, by let's say proverbs, if you get up in the morning and such and such a thing happens. There is something very deterministic about it, and to reverse that, to give it a little fresh air, I'll turn it around. And so I have a sequence of six poems which are entirely made up of these things, and they're called, the common title is ""Concerning my Neighbors, the Hittites"", and the...why the Hittites [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5406]...why not? [Laughter]. Hittites were simply something that I had not the slightest idea about and I sort of saw ourselves one day becoming the Hittites, you know, somebody sitting one day in some future century and, our century being, sort of the Hittites, you know. And so there are six poems, and, I guess that's about all to be said.

I'd like to introduce you to two poets who are Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639] friends of mine. Their poetry is quite different, as you'll discover. But from my own point of view, they...I owe both of them a debt that is similar in both cases though neither probably knows it. They've made me, in their own ways, rethink my own feelings about  what ought to constitute poetry and poems. And in the case of Maxine Gadd, this thinking went into a review which was then sent to the Firepoint which then folded. So you may never see that. And in the case of Andy Schroeder [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4755619], found its way into a long tape harangue between the two of us on the subject of form in poetry. Which I think is now in the Sir George Williams Library [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5159005], where any of you can endure it if you wish to. At any rate, the first of these poets to read will be Maxine Gadd. There will be a fifteen minute break, and then Andreas Schroeder will read. Maxine.

Oh boy. Can you hear me? I don't know how much projection to do. I don't know how much to talk about the poetry. My connection is very loose to the mainstream I guess, because, I don't know, I'm just not socially related to what's going on maybe in the poetry reading. I guess my identifications with words are somewhat with a West Coast hippie trip. And between the country and the city, the first feeling being, you know, the desire for purity, you know when you're seventeen or eighteen years old and you've figured the country life is it. And later coming to realize the necessity of the communal life and the city. So I think that's a task I'm going to try to set myself right here. I...this...I'm going to read first of all the second ""well"" poem, which I did, experienced in the country, living in the country. I remember the first ""well"" poem, I don't remember where it's gone, because it didn't get published. I disregarded its importance, you know. I tended to take the judgment of editors, and you know, people that set themselves up as authorities, and that's why I'm here, you know. I've kept close enough to them, I guess. I remember the first one went something like, ""Wanting pure water I went to the well/too wonderful""...and there was something about the oracle as the bucket clacked. This is the “Second Well Poem”.

Which is about where I feel right now. But that's about where my connection to poetry is right now. I wonder if that...I wonder if that one's around. I don't think it is. I guess I'll just take it as it comes. There's some scheme in this. I guess, I got published by a cat, by bill bissett [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4911496] you might have heard, who did the thing, did the guru thing, the super-energy thing of getting a lot of work done, and getting a lot of people's work out, and a lot of his work out, a lot of it was real shit but he got it out, you know, and some of it worked and some of it didn't, but there was so much of it, you know...I'd like to have had that confidence, you know, I guess almost, most people write poetry, they've got it all in their trunk, you know, they don't get it out. But I guess that's what it takes. This is from one of his first, really cheap magazines. He put, he...it's typed, you know. Pretty good typing. His typing got worse, I get very angry, he makes lots of mistakes. But he did a lot of drawings and things, if anybody wants to look at it, you know.  I mean, he did it minimum, you know, he was living really poor. And a lot of people still read his stuff, so, I mean, to me he was a folk poet in that sense, a lot of people still read his stuff because he got the stuff out cheap, you know. ""Trip"".

I'm going to go over there. This one is to a poet who is in the, is in another world, okay? He looks like a silver lizard, and he's very beautiful, and he knows all about the Greek trip, and Eleusis, which is one's talking about in the first poem, okay, the oracles from under the ground, that belief you must start out with.

Leary, I should have mentioned, was Timothy Leary. Oh, I should have explained that before, yeah. Oh yeah, this is where I met...now I don't like it okay? And it's probably not a good poem. But that's, that's...you know, that's...the kind of art form I'd like to have seen as a collective art form, was what I yearned and hoped for. Poetry is what people write in rooms alone, and I don't like...I don't, you know, that's what I was stuck with. And I worked for a while with a group in Vancouver called, named, we called it ""Intermedia"". And I had the experience of working with a group, at one point there were five of us poets, you know, or what we called poets. And we'd go around to various places, we went to Edmonton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2096] one time, and we tried things, we tried chanting and wailing, like, was it...who was that crazy old lady. Sitwell, Edith Sitwell [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q259921], remember her? And if you ever heard the sort of sing, the song, sing sing she used to do, you know, we tried that. And it really worked, you know, but you'd go around and you'd say, ""Do you dig the poems?"" and they'd say, ""I can't hear them, but we really like your voice."" You know. [Audience laughter]. So, you know, left that, you got an ache in the gut or something.

I don't like it. I don't want to be there. Here's one from last year. I got into printing stuff myself, you know, and I do that--I wish, oh, you can't see it, can you? It was mimeograph, it was real cheap, you know? And you could take images, you could take newspaper articles, you could take scraps of anything you saw that you dug, you know, put 'em together, and to me that was a, that was a form of concrete poetry. Can't, of course, I don't know, you couldn't really say that one or any number of them. This one is half-said, okay. Behind it I put a map, I found a map of B.C. [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1974]and Minster Island [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21906024] was a map, was an island I found once when I was working on a ship as a mess girl, on a freighter.

And where that ended up was just over the name Bella Coola [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q815765], which is sort of where they do, can fish. There's no escape, though, you know? And...so then I want to read about Kitsilano [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4179275], where most of...I happened, you know, I grew up. Kitsilano's a sort of slum district of Vancouver. And it's disintegrating, and you probably all experienced this, you know, being city people, you know, they're bulldozing the places, there's no more cheap places to live, and so your friends, you know, you can't live there anymore, your friends can't live there anymore, so whatever you had, which was sometimes very heavy, you know, community's really beautiful, you know? I used to go over and play music with my friends. We had to move out, you know, because the city's being destroyed, and only the people who are well-to-do, who have some sort of stake in the city, you know, who are supporting the structure can stay. And this poem is about somebody who I met one day on the street, you know, and her story, she's sort of sick, just on the street, everything's falling to pieces.

Right. Normally they hang you after a reading. Jesus. I'm going to read from, oh, just kind of a merry jaunt through various books. I think what I'll do is I'll read some of the, some poetry first, and then I'll slip over into fiction. I've just, two days ago, published a book called The Late Man of short fictions and extended prose poems and so on. The work that I've done is gone cyclic in terms of form. I started out with prose poems and went into much more of a linear poetry, and then went back to a fiction which was kind of a half prose poem, half short story, half God knows, film script. And right now I'm working hard at both styles. First book I published was called The Ozone Minotaur, and it was more surreal than anything I'm doing now. I really get very excited about illusions, and I guess that's probably what most of my work is all about. At first I was very interested in surreal illusions; now I'm very interested in real illusions, and I'm not sure there's any difference. Here's a prose poem from way back called ""Introduction"".

After I found out that you couldn't live by writing poetry, I took a job with CPAir [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q986941]. That doesn't really sound like a very logical progression, but anyway, it was a teletype machine that they put me on, I think I lasted about four days, but I got a poem out of it, and it's entitled ""Cables"".

This next book, File of Uncertainties, I supposed was kind of created when I woke up one morning and was overwhelmed with my own ignorance, so I decided to write a book about it. [Audience laughter]. And then I figured the best way to do it was to go up north and I did that, and I spent a winter up in Alaska [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q797]. And that was where I really got into this illusion thing, because, you know, all the different, very very strange things that happen there, like white-outs, which you probably are familiar with here, as well, where a man suddenly loses all sense of up and down and forward and backward. They have better ones than that, though. They have, until the snowmobile rolls around, when people used to mush with dogs, they'd continually have this happening: a man would set off from one village for another, with his dogs, and he'd be perfectly well-dressed and perfectly well-fed, and apparently perfectly sane, and the dogs would arrive, and the sled would arrive but the man wouldn't, and they possibly found him and possibly not. But no one could ever understand what would make a man suddenly step off his sleigh and walk off in an entirely different direction to die. When he certainly didn't have it on his list of things to do when he left. They still haven't figured that out. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that man's body is made up of such an incredible percentage of water, and very strange things happen to water up there. [Audience laughter]. Anyway, I almost got caught by an avalanche, so I thought I'd check into it and I'd find out what you do if you do get caught by one, cause I figured by that time that survival was probably a good thing. So, they said, one of the things you do is, if you get caught by an avalanche, you make swimming motions with your hands. I guess the idea is that kind of tends to keep you close to the surface, which is a good place to be. Now...[audience laughter] the lovely illusion part, which really intrigued me, was that a man can survive under the snow up to a depth of approximately six feet, but only for a certain period of time, and apparently the closer you are to the surface, the better your chances are, and the way they dig for, well, it's not necessarily logical up there, at least it didn't seem like it, but the way they dig for a man like this is they use sounding rods, and these are very sensitive rods, like, almost like tuning forks, and they walk along, in a very definite rhythm, it's almost like a musical score, and they ram these poles in, one foot deep, about a foot at a time, and attempt to hit somebody that's buried underneath it. And then they go back again and they do it at two feet, and then at three feet and four feet to six feet, they don't go any deeper. Now the peculiar part of it is that they of course can't hear anyone, but the poor bugger that's under the snow can hear very, very clearly. And, you know, and he'll hear people saying, like I wonder where, I think there's a place he might be, and he'll be shouting in there, saying, ""I'm here,"" you know, ""I'm here!"" and they can't hear him, and it's really quite terrifying. Sound only travels one way through an avalanche, I don't...[Audience laughter]. Anyway, I'll, let me read some poems about it, I'll...File of Uncertainties was written in a very short time and mostly about the same thing, and you'll find recurring images all the way through, stylistic things that are similar all the way through, and the poems, because they match together fairly tightly, I didn't even bother naming them, I just numbered them, because they're all part of the same sequence. This is number four.

I took up sky-diving after I came back and, because...yeah, believe it or not, it had very similar illusions going for it again. When...it's much like the white-out. When you jump off an aircraft, and it banks away, generally to your left, then you suddenly lose all points of reference. And because the earth below you is much too far away to really mean anything, and your parachute is still on your back, in other words not opened, so you can't, you haven't got anything above you either, you suddenly get hit with this incredibly stony silence, and absolutely nothing happens. I mean, you don't fall, you're not moving, you're not even really thinking because it's so suddenly quiet. It seems like everything just freezes. And in fact you're falling at about three hundred feet a second, but you have no sense of it whatsoever. And you just stand there in the sky, and kind of look around, and nothing is going on. Which is why you're not supposed to be stoned when you skydive because, [audience laughter] sometimes people tend to forget, you know. So I wrote a poem about it, and, actually it's not...well anything. It's “#9”, is what it is.

I think I'll just let that go for a minute there and go into some prose and then I'll just read some unpublished poems. This first story that I'm going to read is entitled ""The Tree"", and I wrote it after I met a very lovely old man down in Australia [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q408]. Very old. He was an aborigine, and we tried to communicate; he didn't know my language and I didn't know his, which is maybe why we got along so well, but anyway, I built a story up on him. This was on a coral island...of course all islands down there are coral islands.

Pub fights have sort of a beautiful ritualistic thing as long as you're not involved, like if you're just kind of watching, and the Cecil Hotel staged one one night and after that I wrote this, although it has nothing to do with that.

Introducer
00:00:00
About seven years ago, our lives intersected for about two years at the University of Iowa [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182973], where Christopher [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5112730], along with two or three other poets suddenly arrived, in that middle state [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1546?wprov=srpw1_0] in the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30?wprov=srpw1_0], with not just English accents, but a whole body of literatures and languages behind them. Christopher was not just in the poetry workshop, but was doing a lot of translations from German and Dutch, writing his own poetry, was a kind of formidable character with these obscure languages, at least obscure to me at the time. He has since come on, after doing his Ph.D. at Carleton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1041737] where he is an Assistant Professor of English. His third book of poems, Stills, is being published in the next few weeks by Chatto and Windus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3666843], and should be looked for at your bookstores. He's asked for it to come but it hasn't arrived yet. So without any further delay, Christopher Levenson. 
 
Christopher Levenson
00:01:54
Good evening. Trying to decide what I'm going to read this evening, presents the same sort of problems that it always does, when one's being asked to divide oneself up into certain sections, decide which poems you like best, and you know, you love them all, and don't want to make any choices. And to find some headings, some pigeonholes. Well, I'm not very good at this, but I'll start off with a few poems about the United States, about Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16?wprov=srpw1_0], starting off with places, and then move on to some slightly more personal ones, before the interval. Alright, the first poem I want to read is called ""Modus Vivendi"", which, it sounds a bit affected, having a foreign language titles, but I felt this said a little bit more than simply 'way of life' because ‘modus vivendi’ implies something very transitory, and that was one of the aspects of my first impressions at least of American life, that struck me very forcibly, this really came out of my very first day in the States, traveling from New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] to Chicago [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1297?wprov=srpw1_0] by train.
 
Christopher Levenson
00:03:42
Reads ""Modus Vivendi"" [from Cairns].
 
Christopher Levenson
00:05:20
Then, a poem that will be in stills called ""Metropolis"". Well I think this is self-explanatory, and in fact one of reasons why I like reading aloud, is because a fair number of my poems are self-explanatory and don't have to say too much about them. So I won't. ""Metropolis"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:05:49
Reads ""Metropolis"" [from Stills].
 
Christopher Levenson
00:06:57
That, I suppose, really brands me as--emotionally speaking, as a European, because it's different here in Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340]. I've not been to Quebec [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2145] yet, it's different in one or two places, but on the whole, you know, I find myself looking in vain for this sense of a centre. Now, a poem that I wrote not too long ago in Ottawa [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1930]. Called ""Office"", it's a shorter one. Sort this out a bit. Last time I gave a reading, somebody knocked water all over it. Here we go.
 
Christopher Levenson
00:07:54
Reads ""Office"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:08:15
And then one which is my main claim so far, I suppose, to writing a Canadian poem, ""Horse Sleigh"", certainly it's not one that I could have written anywhere else. One of the kids is at nursery school and they take them out each winter on a horse sleigh ride, and I went along. So, of course, it's not really about a horse sleigh.  One word- half way through, the word 'revenants' these are ghosts that come back to their own--literally, their old haunts. And can't seem to keep away from the place. ""Horse Sleigh"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:09:07
Reads ""Horse Sleigh"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:09:57
Then, another poem, based pretty obviously I think on personal experience, in the States. It's called ""A Bad Trip"", not mine, somebody else's, but this would be, this I felt was sort of enough to keep me off it. Anyway, ""A Bad Trip"".

Then, one which came a long, long time after I was actually told of this incident by my wife in fact, and it must be something like 1956, actually it happened, a carnival referred to is a German carnival, and I guess things have changed quite a bit since then. ""Song of the Unmarried Mother"".

Reads ""Song of the Unmarried Mother"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:14:28
Then maybe have a little bit of pseudo light relief before we go on. ""Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst"". Which is another, sort of relic, but again not a personal one, this started off as a fine number of my poems do from things people say to me. The first two lines here, ""They took me across the river, they laid me up the hill"", were almost exactly what somebody said. And I took it from there. Alright, ""The Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst"".

Reads ""Old Friend"" [from Stills].
 
Christopher Levenson
00:19:11
And, ""Maps"". I've always been fascinated by maps and I find looking through my poems, certain images keep on recurring. One of them is that of maps, another one, as maybe you'll see later, is of stones, [unintelligible] and so on. And what I'm referring to in the first section here are these old maps where great chunks have come true and not known and so they just put in a zephyr, a wind, you know, or a dragon, or a dolphin or something like that to  make up for their ignorance. ""Maps"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:19:58
Reads ""Maps"" [from Stills].
 
Christopher Levenson
00:21:29
Then, a thing in this first part, I'll just read. One found poem, and then two excerpts from a sort of longer work in process. The found poem, I dedicate to Howard and [Marty (?)] Fink because that's where I found it. It's called the ""Bowfoot Scale"". The beaufort scale is simply an explanation in terms of miles per hour, I've left that column out, and in terms of symptoms so to speak of these words that you hear on the weather reports, calm, slight breeze and so forth. ""Beaufort Scale"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:22:21
Reads ""Beaufort Scale"".
 
Christopher Levenson
00:23:31
[Laughter]. I dare say it's a found poem. It's not really mine. I get a lot of fun out of finding poems. Now these next two excerpts are from a poem which is tentatively entitled, ""Hopkins in Piccadilly"", it won't be called that in the end, it's just, it started off thinking what Gerard Manley Hopkins [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313693] would think of contemporary London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84], but it soon left that idea behind and what it's going to be now is a poem in several sections about various aspects of London. Trying to use as many words in my poems that I don't normally use in poems, you know, or that one does not normally see used in poems, and so a lot of, words which are not normally part of my poetic vocabulary. I'm not trying to be arch or archaic or anything like that, simply to expand my vocabulary and, hope to, therefore, I can say new things. Now the two that I've got semi finished, or at least enough to read, one's called ""Charing Cross Road"", if you know London, England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21], you'll know that this is the road in which you find both some very good book shops and a lot of very sleazy so called hygienic stores, and it's this aspect I'm concentrating on there, and then the second one is on Hyde Park [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123738], with the idea of the public speakers and the orators. ""Charing Cross Road"" then.
 
Christopher Levenson
00:25:25

Christopher Levenson
00:26:34
That's as far as I've got with that bit so far. The next one, ""Hyde Park"", the Hyde Park Speaker's Corner [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q510323] is what I'm thinking of particularly.
 
Christopher Levenson
00:26:47

I'll read a few so called political poems, they're not really political in the normal sense, not sort of party political or anything like that, simply concerned about relationships between people in the community or sort of national attitudes, that sort of thing, more than specific political issues. Although this first one that I'm going to read, ""Terrorist"", comes, I think, fairly obviously from a particular situation, with which you here are particularly well acquainted. I was thinking, particularly of the FLQ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1129564] crisis [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27702], but it could apply to any terrorist.

I suppose if I have a recurring theme in these quasi-political poems, it is that, the tyranny of the ideal if you like, the way in which we force things to become what we want them to become. Force ourselves to see things so that they fit into our pre-selected beliefs. Alright, a rather different sort of poem called ""The Facts of Life"".  This too will be in the book.

And another poem that comes from the same sort of period, as I said, I like finding poems, and this one I found in the window of a pharmacy, this time they had notices saying 'watch for these danger signs', they were danger signs of cancer, and I call this little poem, which is, as I say, a political poem, so I won't explain the metaphor any further, ""Introduction to Cancer Diagnosis"".

Another poem, ""Epitaph for a Killer"", I think you will probably remember the incident this starts from. Charles Whitman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453209] going up the University library tower [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28403236] in Austin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16559], Texas and just picking a few people off with his telescopic lens gun. And the thing that struck me when I read these reports, as it so often happened with Richard Speck [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944350] and all those other sort of, mass killers, that people said, 'oh, but he was such a nice boy, such an ordinary boy' you know, 'such a decent lad'. You know, how could anyone so ordinary, you know if he had long hair, or if he'd been a hippie, we would have expected it. But you know, because they didn't go 'round the little- labels on them, they were expected to have conformed completely, and of course they didn't. ""Epitaph for a Killer"".

I always forget until I finish reading that poem that that last line is not self-explanatory. It's a disease--I think it's called Sickle disease--Pardon? [audience member addresses Levenson]. Sickle Cell Disease [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q185034], okay. Which apparently affects mainly African Negroes, and this is some sort of deficiency in the blood quite simply, but something which is totally inexplicable in the genes anyway. Alright, another, one more sort of pseudo or quasi political poem, this one is called ""Boreland Burlap"". Again, I don't know if you know exactly what I am referring to, but I think the poem explains it sufficiently, the way you get trees transplanted whole nowadays.

And now, a section of poems, well, I've put ironically, self-ironically, ""The Solution"" I mean, having presented some political problems--of course, there are no solutions. What I've tried to do in some of the poems I'm going to read now is simply to capture certain textures, or to suggest certain qualities that I admire, or certain aspects of character. The first, well I think probably the only rock poem I'm going to read this evening, called ""Fossil"".

I think the rest of it's self-explanatory.

I think I'll read three more poems if you bear with me, these come under the general heading of 'Art', really the relationship of art to life, though this first one is at least, would-be light poem, called ""The Quartet"", to Carleton, where I teach now. We have a series of concerts in the winter, and most of them are pretty good but one particular one wasn't and it set me thinking about the whole marvelous artificiality of chamber music in a way.

Then, a poem called ""Watch the Birdie"" which is about the cost of art in human terms. If you know what a sea urchin is like in its natural and in its final state, final [unintelligible] state, it'll help. You know they're all, like, sort of hedgehogs or porcupines and you have to scrape all the spines off and then gauge the insides out, but that's described in lurid detail.

That sounds a bit pretentious, I'm afraid, those last four words in Latin, but it means ""you also"", or ""you likewise"", and I know gulls' cries don't really sound like that but, that seemed to me the briefest most concise way of making that point at the end of the poem. Finally, a poem which attempts to link love and art. Called ""Bathysphere"", or rather the kind of knowledge involved in both.

L.E. Sissman's three books of poems are Dying: An Introduction, Scattered Returns and Pursuit of Honor. The poet James Atlas made the following observation about Scattered Returns that it ""engages a voice so casual, so tuneless that the depression which pervades each page is in danger of being overlooked. Not the shrill agony of despair, but the flat surfaces of the unfulfilled or what characterizes his diction"". But also I'd like to take a line from a Sissman poem out of context, ""evidently, even desperation leads a charmed life"". Ladies and gentleman, L.E. Sissman.

Thank you. Well let me begin by refuting one of those statements that Stanley just made, Stanton, I'm sorry, just made. I was not a singing vacuum cleaner salesman, that was a canard that was incorporated into my vita by my publisher, who misread a biographical note I wrote. I once worked for a vacuum cleaner company that made its salesmen sing pep songs before they went out to tackle the ladies in the neighbourhood, so we'd get up in the morning and sing all these ridiculous songs and then go out and try to sell vacuum cleaners but the two were not really related, it was just hyping oneself up for the gritty day of trying to sell these poor ladies on a vacuum cleaner. Now I've seen you've kindly reproduced, and incidentally you've been most kind here in Montreal, I've been received royally, more so than any place I've been lately to read poetry and I greatly appreciated, I feel it's kind of a homecoming since my mother is a Canadian, from Ontario [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904], not Quebec [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q176], but I've been in Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34] many times before and I'm very fond of this city and if I finally lose patience with the U. S. and A. [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] as Walt Kelly [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q933892] says in Pogo [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2100584] I'll migrate up here, I feel it an eminently sensible thing to do. So it's nice to have a pleasant reception here. And since you've kindly reproduced one of the poems from a group called ""Mouth Organ Tunes: the American Lost-and-Found"" on your mimeographed sheet, I thought I'd start off by reading that poem. I'm going to say a few words at the risk of being dull about what each one of these poems I'm going to read is for, what I meant it to mean. This particular one is talking about the well, kind of what James Atlas was talking about in his comment on my second book, this is in my third book, the terminal flatness and greyness of American life, United States life, and the attempts to alleviate this barrenness by all sorts of temporizing accommodations, going to Howard Johnson's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5919997] on a Sunday, or having a kinky party in New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] to show off one's new paintings or celebrating the death of a genuine antique American and New Englander and looking at the house that he lived in and so on. Anyway the tune is called, the poem is called ""Mouth Organ Tunes"", and I use the mouth organ as an instrument here to suggest the, well the mouth organ is something that can be played in a band, but is better not, it's a very solitary instrument and to me it always conveys the loneliness of an individual against insurmountable odds. The poem is called ""Mouth Organ Tunes: The American Lost-and-Found"" and the first section is called, as promised, ""In a Ho-Jo's by the River"".

Let me contrast that with a poem about Middle America in the best sense. The old Middle America of people who knew their own way and found their own way in the land, and lost their own way in recent years because of encroachments on the land. The poem is called ""The Big Rock Candy Mountain"" and it's dedicated to the memory of my half-brother, Winfield Shannon, itinerant farm worker, 1909-1969. And it has an epigraph by Basil Bunting [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2886803] which goes ""a mason times his mallet to a lark's twitter, ‘til the stone spells the name, naming none, a man abolished"".

Let me change to a slightly lighter vein, and read a poem that is a joke, essentially. It's called ""The Birdman of Cambridge, Mass."" It's about a man I once roomed with in college, who was an Audobonophile, or whatever the word is, a bird nut and has since become a bird expert.

Thank you, she was a very nice lady, and deserved a much less ironic tribute than that, she was a home away from home herself. Let's see now, I've got all sorts of possible choices here. Why don't I read a poem about a shattering experience I had which I think maybe all of you may have had at one time or another, going back to a place where you had lived as a kid, and finding how puny it was and how destroyed it was by the passage of time. This is a poem about a place in Detroit where I had lived in the 30's and went back to in 1964 when the poem was written. It's called ""East Congress and McDougall Streets, Detroit, May 25"".

Oh I just did a review of Al Purdy's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4704621] new book of poems so maybe I'll just start off reading that. [Audience laughter]. I said I liked it Al. [Audience laughter]. I'm related to practically everybody here. I'll turn this off now. [Audience laughter].

...I think that George Bowering  [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280] has read or done— or not done, or not written. On the back of [that book (?)], it says that he has two new books, one called Curious from Coach House Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5137585], and another In the Flesh, coming out with McClelland and Stewart [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6800322]. The one thing I can add to that is— has to do with baseball [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5369], about which I know much less than George. You still have your team?

00:04:51
Yes.
 
Introducer
00:04:54
Okay, it's occurred to me that George understands one thing that is rather important to understand that is that the difference between stepping up to the plate and hitting the ball out of the park, and going [unintelligible], on the one hand, and on the other, stepping up to the plate and being there when the bat does what it's supposed to do and the ball takes itself out of the park. And this applies to baseball, and it also applies to poems. And that's what George understands.

I'm reading for the next three weeks back and forth but this is the first one so I haven't got stale with any of this stuff yet in the east. And I'm going to come back in a few minutes to Autobiology, because I've never read it in the east although I started writing it in Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340] and finished it in Vancouver [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639], but before I do I'm going to read a piece that is sort of representative of what I've been doing lately in Vancouver, called ""Desert Elm"", the desert being the Okanagan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1812222] in this instance and the elm being the kind of tree that people planted there that wasn't there before and grew— they tried a lot of other ones and they didn't work. And it's a poem about my father and it deals with— it was begun with his heart attack he had in August and what happened after that, to me.

He was supposed to be moving— that was in the summer of '65, he was up in Vancouver and just decided to move up there so he wouldn't die, and because he would die if he stayed in San Francisco [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62], and then he said, well just before that I'll go down to the San Francisco Poetry Festival, and when that's over in three weeks I'll come up to Vancouver, and he died during the second week. Okay, this is— Autobiology is a book  that came out, two years ago this month, actually, 72, yeah. And I started writing it in Westmount [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q139497] as they say and finished it in Kitsilano [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4179275]. I started writing it in an expensive flat in Westmount, and finished it in a commune on the edge of the water in Vancouver and it's a story about, as it suggests, it's a story, it's a book, it's poetry, it's prose, it's something about things that have changed me in terms of my head but first in terms of chemicals and physiologically, changed my body literally and so on. So I'll just, I'll read portions of it. I toyed with the idea of reading the whole book, it's the sort of thing we do in Vancouver, like we sit down and read the whole book, and this was published the same day as Stan Persky's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2330087] The Day, a book called The Day, and it's the same length, about a hundred pages, and he read The Day and we took a break, and I read Autobiology and then we took a break of a couple of hours and he read The Day again. But that's sort of— that happens a little— it's a little easier to take when everybody is kind of a volunteer anyway, when everybody in the audience has known all the time that this was being written and that it was going to be read, the whole book. So I'll just read parts of it so you get a taste of it. Each section is about one and a quarter foolscap pages when it's handwritten, long, approximately so it turns out to be about two of these pages. ""Chapter One""— there's forty-eight chapters. ""Chapter One: The Raspberries"".

Did that ever happen to--I'm sure these kinds of things must have happened to--the way I was telling [unintelligible] this afternoon that the way this book is written was I knew the general frame was things that changed me that way, from things put in my body, generally, or pieces of my body taken off, or whatever. Or pieces of my body going out into someone else's body or whatever. And I'd go home in my house in Westmount, from here, and I'd say 'I got it! Today I'm going to do the broken tool part' and I'd run home and I'd start controlling the thing and I'd throw it away, so all the pieces that are in here are the pieces that are not thrown away, the ones where I didn't know what I was going to write when I started writing. I have the sense that I tried to describe that afternoon as being simply equal to what was coming in the story. This is ""Chapter 2"", I'll read ""Chapter 1"" and 2 and 3 and 4 and then I'll skip. This is ""The Teeter Totter"".

Oh, here's one that every once in a while there's, it comes to, the thing comes to writing itself or talking about the writing of itself, so here's one called ""Composition"", for those that are worried about the problem it'll be totally clear.

Can't get out of it, you know, that's your problem— you don't think you need... So this one is sort of a reply to that, it's called ""The Childhood"".

The second one was Autobiology and the third one was Curious and the fourth one is— Dwight Gardiner wrote it, in a book called the Book of the Occasional. I was going to write it but he wrote it, so I didn't have to. It's just absolutely beautiful and if you see a Book of the Occasional, you'll see what I mean. It's just a gorgeous, gorgeous book.

This is a book—a thing called The Big Leagues and it's in a few- in five sections and maybe I'll get tired before I get to the fifth one, but I'll just see how— the first one is called ""The Detroit Tigers"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q650855].

I think I'll read like for ten minutes and that'll be for a total of an hour, five minutes or something like that. I'll just, I'll pick, this is Curious, which is a— that other book's coming out, it's called In the Flesh and it's maybe the last book of occasional, magazine book verse poetry I ever do. It deals with the experience of being in your 30s and finding out that the world isn't round after all and how sad you can be and how strong emotions can be. It has an introduction called ""I Never Felt Such Love"". But it's mainly lyric poetry, and I just, I've read so much of that that it's got to be too easy to read and write and everything. So I'll read a few of these. The poets who are mentioned in Curious, it happens that there are a lot of my friends who aren't in the book. Because, again, I wrote it that way, if you know, if that person did not come up, excuse me, from the other side of the page or however that feeling is to be described, if the voice wasn't there or something, for instance I really wanted to do a Roy Kiyooka [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789] poem, and you know, I just couldn't and it didn't come and I had wanted to but if I had tried that it just would have been screwed up. Some of these are American, some are Canadians, a couple are English and maybe one or two other things. And the first one is, naturally, Charles Olson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q922978]. Olson, as you probably know, was about 6 ft 10 and weighed about 300 pounds. And I first met him— I was standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs and he was coming down them. So I said 'hello' to the knees of his sear-sucker suit.

It's not my favourite but it's one that I like reading. David McFadden— well, it tells you what he's like, but David McFadden is a— he scared the hell out of Allen Ginsberg [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711] because he writes really funny poems, like he literally has things, like he walks out into the backyard and sees the Archangel Gabriel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81989] or a space man and just talks to it and talks about it in the story of the poem a paragraph after he's talked about going out and buying some cigarettes or something like that and Ginsberg thought, wow, what a weird spaced out guy, so Victor Coleman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23882910] took him down to Hamilton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133116] to see David, David— he's got, as he said in the note of one of his books, ""I was born in 1940 and I comb my hair straight back"", and in his house, he's got an electric pendulum clock and you know that sort of thing. And Ginsberg took one look and said [inaudible ‘scared’ sound], and ran away. Just couldn't believe it, you know, it's unbelievable. So, David McFadden.

Now I plan to read from The Man in Yellow Boots, published this year, 1965, and in this book, I tend to move away from experimentation [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1384425], although I still retain many of the things that I tried to work out in the first book.

Well, I feel about poetry in a curious way, I guess. I have a very strong classical streak in me, I think, I like poems that are very regular, and poems that rhyme, and poems that are passionately intellectual, and I think that I feel this way because the poems that are the most passionately intellectual have a way of spilling over into something which is completely free in its feeling. Oh here's a little poem by Ben Jonson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193857]. It's called ""On My First Sonne"" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7091055]. A little elegy.

Poor old Ben Jonson, in a pig's eye. The next poem I would like to say is by an American poet, W.S. Merwin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q680368], who has just published his selected translations, and of course in addition to the very beautiful poems of his own that Merwin has, he's been a prolific translator, and he, he really does know the languages. I've loved his poetry always because he has such a beautiful ear, it was very interesting to me when I saw him in New York [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60] a few weeks ago, when he said that his Selected Translations were about to appear. I asked him if he remembered the transla--well of course he remembered, I just told him I always liked very much the poem he had translated, a later poem by Garcia Lorca [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41408]called ""Gacela of Unforseen Love"". What a weird thing! He didn't remember that he had done it. And it's not in his book. Well, I wish it were. ""Gacela of Unforseen Love"".

Here in Montreal [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340] I've been thinking about what in the United States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30] we hear about Montreal, about the English background, and the French background, and the Canadian, all of which are very vital and alive, but what do you make of the Irish up here? Are there any Irishmen in Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16]? [pauses for response]. Just on March 17th. Only on March 17th, fine. My own family background is kind of complicated. I'm an Ohioan, which is a kind of hell in itself [audience laughter]. But both sides of my family have roots in the south, but they have a strong streak of Irish behind them; it wasn't until I was quite old that I found out about some of Irish literature, of course we've all of us read Yeats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213]. The son of a bitch. He not only did everything first but he did it best. We all feel that. But really he didn't do it all first. He may have done it best but there are some Irish things that I found that perhaps he grew out of it. Do you know for example, the poems of, of all people, Jonathan Swift [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41166]? Jonathan Swift is a wonderful poet. He published Gulliver's Travels [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q181488] in 1725, and I found a little poem of his called ""On Burning a Dull Poem"". Of 1729. And it has a, it's a wonderful expression of the Irish art of the curse. I shouldn't lean on this. I don't mean the poem, I mean the lectern. [Audience laughter]. But it's a wonderful example of the Irish art of the curse, what is supposed to be very regular and it's almost like a prayer. The art here is that you should decide first of all whether or not what you feel annoyed by really is worthy of a curse. And then if it is, you should not come out and blast it directly, but exercise some indirection on it. So here we have Swift, ""On Burning a Dull Poem"".

I can't help bringing that a little closer to our own time. We all know the very beautiful plays of John Millington Synge [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213447]. Perhaps people haven't so widely enjoyed his poems. He didn't write a great many, but to my mind he wrote enough. He also, he made a translation of Petrarch [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1401] into the same language as those people, as those women on the Aran Islands [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q212893] who used to clean his room. He said he learned something about the rhythm of his language just by listening to them. So that in the sound of the Petrarch after Laura is dead and is appearing in heaven, and the angels are astonished by her beauty, the sestet of that sonnet, in Synge's translation, the angels see Laura and suddenly say, ""What rare beauty is that now? What rare beauty at all."" So that those old women who cleaned his room on the Aran Islands have the voices of the angels. Well, after The Playboy of the Western World [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q451517] was first produced, he was criticized and he wanted to write something about the criticism. He didn't know whether the, who the critic was, really, he didn't know anything about him, he didn't know whether or not the critic had a sister. But there was the poem, and since he realized, as Aristotle [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q868] said, that “poetry is a higher and more philosophical thing than history”--history being limited to what is or was, and poetry having available to it what ought to be, what might be...Synge invented a sister, and he wrote a little poem called ""Upon the Sister of the Critic who Attacked the Playboy"". [Audience laughter]. This is a prayer. [Audience laughter]. And blasphemy also is a very delicate art. ""Lord""...no I have to say, that you have to understand, really what ""Mountjoy"" is. Mountjoy is a place on the edge of Dublin [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1761], a kind of charity place where the Skid Rowers go.

I came to like those Irish poets, so much, because they enjoyed poetry. My God, you've got to do something, life is a mess. Well, alright, I want to say one more poem that I care about. I know I'm going on too long with this business. One more. Let me say it in English first, and you can't say that I'm translating at sight, but perhaps by ear, and it'll be very awkward, but it's not awkward in the German. When--it's a poem that doesn't have a title. I don't think I'll tell you who wrote it. The poem goes: ""When the clocks nearby strike as if their own hearts were beating, and things--that is, material objects-things, with hesitant voices say to me softly, ‘Are you there?’ Then I am not the same man who woke this morning, for the night has sent me a name which no one to whom I spoke by daylight can listen to without being deeply frightened. Every door in me opens, and then I know that nothing dies, neither gesture, nor prayer. Things are too heavy for that. My whole childhood stands always around me. I am never alone. Many who live before me, and many who spring forth from me”--which I would also, I suppose, translate as ‘many who spring forth out of my body'--”wove, wove into my being. And if I sit down opposite you and say, lightly, I have been suffering, do you hear? Who knows? Who murmurs that voice with me?""

Oh, no that's corny, of course it's by Rilke [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76483]. I mean it's corny to hold back the name. It's one of those lyrics that Rilke wrote between those New Poems [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7011009] and the big terrible ones, the Duino Elegies [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q688426] and the Sonnets. Well, let me proceed now to some poems of my own. The first one I think I will read is a poem called ""A Note left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack"". I've been thinking about that poem a little bit recently for a lot of reasons. I think I should tell you something about what's behind it. There was an old guy called Minnegan Leonard who, or maybe Francis Leonard, who grew up--no, [laughter] I mean he was old, I grew up--he was already there [audience laughter]. Back in Martins Ferry [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1018313], Ohio [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1397]. The story about him was that he had been a very well-educated man and he sort of deteriorated, everyone said. One night, a couple of friends and I found him in the, when the snow was starting to fall. And his, he wore a pair of overalls, the ones that cross behind, and they were too big, my friends and I helped him get home. We were very much afraid of his brother, Jimmy. Minnegan had drunk so much that his brain was practically gone, and he had nothing left to say to the universe except ""God bless my soul."" We were stupid, we were afraid of his brother Jimmy, because his brother Jimmy, although drunk, was still mean. He still had some of his humanity left. And we were afraid of him. I thought about this poem as being spoken by a boy, I was about twelve years old. I also wanted to see if I could get away with swearing in a poem, and give the word, give the profanity some of its true force. The only thing that I deplore about the open use of profanity is that very soon, when the four-letter words are used commonly, they start to lose touch with their old, magical, dark force. When I was in the army, twenty years ago, I realized that this happened. You couldn't say ""fuck"" to refer to anything dark or anything interesting. It became a musical notation. Merely a musical notation, like a comma, when you were having chow. [Audience laughter]. But then there came those necessary moments when one absolutely needs to curse, and what does one do then? Then I saw all sorts of people around me, floundering, turning to what Wordsworth would have called the ""poetic diction,"" and finding that to say ""fuck"" had about as much effect on the release of one's feelings as the Finney crew had on anybody who was trying to read about fish in the end of the 18th century. Then I met a poetic genius named Mark W. Patrick from Crafton, Alabama [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q173], who was not hobbled by this. Someone asked him once, no he had invention, true invention. He knew how to swear. My wife has heard this before. Alright, I'll say it again. Someone said to him, ""Where are you from?"" And he said, ""I come from so far back in the country, they have to fan the coon-farts out of the kitchen to keep from making.” [Audience laughter]. No, wait a minute, you didn't hear the rest of the conceit. Now listen to this carefully and think of it as in Shakespearian. ""I come from so far back in the country they have to fan the coon-farts out of the kitchen to keep from making ring-tailed biscuits."" [Audience laughter]. I thought, let us somehow rescue through invention our power to curse. Well this poem is called, ""A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack"". It's about taking Minnegan Leonard home when he was helpless in the snow.

Now for a while I think I would like to read from my new book. There are a couple of city poems in this new book, well, more than a couple, and many of the things that I had written before were about the country, more or less, in Ohio, and in Minnesota [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1527]. But I developed a certain feeling about cities, I guess, and...I didn't have a very happy time in Minneapolis [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36091] and St. Paul [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28848], but I lived there for about eight years, and before I left I thought I ought to say farewell, somehow. I couldn't think of a title for this poem that would convey or suggest what I really felt, and the true title came to me. I wanted it to be a poem about, not only about Minneapolis but about many American cities, and what has been happening in them. Minneapolis is my favourite because I lived there for quite a while, and they had a very big Skid Row there, and the Skid Row was cleared out by the city administration, the last, the most recent one. It was a very big Skid Row, between the Great Northern Railroad Station and the Mississippi River [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1497], right a strip across there, several blocks wide. And they sort of flattened it. They put up an insurance building and the rest were parking lots. And it never occurred to them that the people who lived there would...well, even existed. And I know where those people went, they went down Nickolet Avenue, scattered down there. It's a very strange thing. Spiro T. Agnew [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q203433], our new American Vice-President said, during the campaign, ""The reasons the slums are so over-crowded is that there are too many people in them."" [Audience laughter]. Well, this is my city poem. It's called ""The Minneapolis Poem"".

This poem is called ""The Poor Washed Up by Chicago Winter"". It's about leaving Chicago [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1297]. I went down there for a long Thanksgiving weekend to visit a man whose poetry I had seen, I had never met him, I admired it very much. His name is Bill Mott. He has finally published a first book. He lived in an area down there where there were some sort of poor people...I don't mean poor people in the sense of being savagely poor, really really put down, but just sort of drifters, the guys who go into the, who go in on Thanksgiving and get a dinner there from the Salvation Army [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188307] and look at it and then sweep up and leave.

You know, George Orwell [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3335] remarked in Down and Out in Paris and London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1355487] that when he got back to London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84] from France [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q142] where he'd been a dishwasher, he had so little money that he realized that he would have to beg, only somehow his clothes, ratty as they were, were still too good to beg with. And so he, he sold what clothes he had, or traded them, rather, for a really crummy suit of clothes, and when he got those old, really poor man's clothes on, he noticed all sorts of strange things. The way people looked at him. The way women looked at him. As well as other men. And the fact that he was poor had an effect on the way people's souls were shaped, somehow. I only had a very slight experience of that in my life, and I don't want any more of it. Because it's not very romantic. For a while I had a sort of, an account at a department store in Minneapolis, and I was behind in my payments. At that time I had an old green coat my father had given me, it didn't quite fit but a coat is a coat. So I had it, and I was, in order to keep myself going one way or another, I went up to the cashier's office at this department store and tried to cash a small cheque for twenty dollars, or something like that. There was a very beautiful girl there, the cashier, and she looked at me, and she disappeared for a moment and she came back with a fellow who had a crew cut. And he evidently was the Grand Vizier, or something. Well, they were about a foot and a half away from my face while I waited, and they talked about me, without paying any attention to me. And I realized something I had never realized before. That I'm, I am content simply to think about it, I don't want it to happen to me again  I thought, Jesus Christ, there are millions of people in this country who are treated like things, every single intimate moment of their lives. And it's not pretty. Well. ""Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store"". The poem is in different parts and I think I'll indicate the numbers.

I think that I'll read a couple of nature poems. Nature, in poetry and song. One of the parts of the United States that I like very much...I came to like, I've spoken kind of harshly about Minneapolis, and I have harsh feelings about that city, but actually I love the West, out at the edge of Minnesota, you have, there's Minnesota, North Dakota [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1207], and South Dakota [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1211], and that part of the country there is sort of the, it's not really flat, it's a little rolling, but it's the beginning of the prairie, and the prairie is a beautiful thing. I spent a summer up around Fargo [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34109], North Dakota, and I like Fargo, I like to walk there in the summer evenings, I would go even out to the other end of town, and, well it really is a real city, there are about eighty-thousand people, but you could walk out to the edge of town, and just a little beyond the town the prairie would begin. There is something about that sudden opening that I like.  his is called, ""Outside Fargo, North Dakota"".

One of these days somebody's going to get a train from New York to Connecticut [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q779] or something and that train will never return, it'll keep coming back, every forty years with ghosts on it, flying Dutchmen. But it's different in the West, and...there's a discontinued railroad station.

And then a couple out of my previous book. This poem is called ""Mary Bly"", it's for my goddaughter, and I stood up there in the church and they said, well, I went through the ceremony and I am her godfather, Mary Bly, it's the first child of my old friend, my old friends, Robert and Carol Bly. I feel very proud of this poem, but it's one of those times that, it signifies one of those times in my life when I really thought of something nice to do and did it. So many things I want to do that would be nice, and usually they turn out to be something either asinine or too late, or something. But I wrote this poem for little Mary's christening, and I had it, it's the only time I've ever done this, I had it specially printed on very nice paper and print and had it put in a little silver frame, and gave it to her mother, on the day of the christening. What a calm thing to pull on an audience, how can you help but like it. [Audience laughter]. If you don't like it, it means you don't like motherhood or small children, no. ""Mary Bly"".

And I think I will conclude with a poem which is just a description. There were some other descriptive poems in my last book which, for some weird reason, drove some reviewers to distraction. For example, in one poem, there was a poem about being at a bus stop at a place in Ohio and looking out the window and seeing a farmer at the beginning of a rain calling his cows in, and one reviewer got terribly upset about this and said, how...he's only stopping there on the bus, how did he know that there were a hundred black and white Holsteins. [Audience laughter]. And Robert Bly urged me and urged me to send the reviewer a postcard. I never did it, I wish I had. It was to have said, ""I counted the tits and divided by four."" [Audience laughter]. Well, no but, just, I just want to present this poem. It's called ""A Blessing"", and for what it is, it's just a description of something.

I want to read some, most of the poems from this section called ""Book of Ayres"", and I want to explain just a little bit about it if I can, I guess the most important thing to say is that they declared themselves as a book of poems, in the middle of a final exam, I was taking an exam and one of the things that we had to deal with was a poem by Emily Dickinson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4441], which I will read to you, it's a marvelous poem, I'd never seen it before. And it's so clearly tied all of the poems I'd been working on for the past year or so together, into a bundle, into a package. Let me read to you the, this little statement which I'd written for the publication of the book, and I, simply to insist that they are before anything else, religious poems, and I, as prepossessing as I am about them now, because I think that I may have occasion later on in the reading to call that, or you may have occasion to call that to mind. That they take, as their focus, the making, the finding of the flesh in the word, that is that the word is flesh and it has to be found as such. But let me just read this statement and then I'll read you the Emily Dickinson poem, we'll go right into the “Book of Ayres”. I hope that they're, also, that they're fun, and then you say 'religion', people say, 'uh-oh', this is going to be very grim and very heavy, and in the old sense of heavy. But I hope we can have fun with them, but simply, let me do this. All the poems in the “Book of Ayres” section Meat Air, were written with the intention, though not entirely conscious ‘til rather late in the series, of making the word flesh. That is, when the poet speaks, his words are physically only air, yet they can afford us the most sensorially tangible of experiences. Further, the poem, though merely air, is what sustains us, what the soul feeds on. The poet speaks to keep the soul of man alive, that's Yeats [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213] in  “John Kinsella's Lament for Mrs. Mary Moore”, it's interesting that as I was grabbing for something to, for support, picked that line, because the line continues, or rather the whole passage goes ""And oh, but she had stories, though not for the priest's ear, to keep the soul of man alive, to banish age and care, and being old, she put a skin on everything she said."" Or as Williams [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106] puts it, ""It is difficult, to get the news from poems, yet we die, every day, for lack of what is found there."" Yet if the word seeks to take on the actuality of flesh, of substance, substance itself, as the poet apprehends it, in the merest of tales of his life, from day to day, seeks to take on the resonating actuality of speech, to realize itself in the actuality of the word. Love itself is both a word and a continuing act or process, both an idea and a tension in the chest, viscera and genitals, a pressure toward articulation so complex that it often stifles speech. About halfway through “The Book of Ayres”, I realized that many of the poems I'd written over the past twelve years or so, had been attempting with various degrees of success to effect these transubstantiations and so, this collection. ""The Dickinson Poem"", which if you want to take a look at it is in Thomas Johnson's editions, it's number “1651”.

I'd like to open the reading with a poem that's really part of a verse-play that I wrote in 1963 or 64, a long time ago, a play that never really made it as a play, but fragments of which I've salvaged because I like, I like what they do. And so this is sort of called ""Fragments of an Imaginary Noh Play"", and this is the dream that one of the figures has.

I'd like to read a few selections from my book of poems The Connexions, which was printed in 1965. I'd like to begin with a poem entitled ""The Command"". I should just briefly mention that these poems were all written in a very short period of time between November and January, mostly, and a few poems written later on throughout that spring of 1965. That is, November 1964 through the early part of 1965. Most of them were written in New York and involved an experience I had there where I was very ill, and part of the time delirious. This poem was actually written a little later than some of the poems that follow. They're not spaced out chronologically in the book. ""The Command"".

This poem, written, actually, previous to the other, is entitled ""Eclipse"", and it was written without my own, without my knowledge, actually, at the time, that there was an eclipse taking place. It was on the eighteenth of December, 1964, written in New York City. This was a lunar eclipse. Isn't there a lunar eclipse about to...is that tonight? [Audience laughter]. It's a full moon tonight. Something's happening.

The she of that last stanza enters into this poem, which was originally entitled ""The Changing of Skin"". There's a good, considerable amount of snake imagery in these poems, all of which was the result of having hepatitis and the turning of colours. I had hepatitis rather badly, and relapsed twice with it, and each time I relapsed, of course, I turned bright yellow again. And it was quite an unusual experience, especially the first time, in which I was in the hospital, and the nurses, especially the young nurses, would come round and look at you with the most peculiar eyes, you know, as if you were really something from another world, having changed colour like that.

After this there's a descent, a further descent down, as has been instructed in an earlier poem, called ""The Command,"" and then a coming-out again. And then a poem that remembers, really, it's quite different, I'm not sure how much this poem really belonged in The Connexions. Most of the poems definitely did belong in the book, I think, though some of them don't bear reading, I don't think, now. This poem bears reading, I think, but doesn't really belong in the book. How's that?

This poem was written about four or five years ago also, and was written after having given a tarot reading for a friend. And I take it that most of you will have some familiarity with the tarot cards, and anyway, the poem attempts in several places to explain, in other places just simply to give you the reading of the tarot as it was done out. And so I've just simply in parts just listed the cards that fell. It's simply called ""A Reading"".

There'd be nothing left to do. This poem is called ""Of Psyche"".

This is an untitled poem, a happy poem, I hope, written in September, on the seventh of September, and it struck me, as it was the seventh of September, that in fact, in the Latin, that September is the seventh month, and was apparently the seventh month of the Roman calendar year. And so I was suddenly taken by that, because, you know, if you write dates very often, you probably use the typical numerical method of you know, putting, the day, and the month, and the year, in terms of numbers. And you usually think of September as the ninth month, which in fact it is, in our calendar, but the word is obviously, suggests, as October suggests the eighth month, September is the seventh. And so I was happy. It seemed like something new was happening. It was nice, because you know, in September, in northern, any part of Ottawa [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1930], Ottawa-area, or Ontario [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904], or Quebec [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q176], you know what's coming, eh? You know, it's still here. So you got to be happy while you can. And it was also, I should add, that even in old times, you know, the calendar year was divided into twelve months, and so the seventh month would, in a sense, be the beginning of a new cycle. It would be six months, and that would end the first half, and there would be six more months, and September would be the first of it again. And that also excited me. It felt like Spring. [Laughter]. But I'm crazy.

And now a sad poem, for someone who has, who had cancer, and is apparently alright, which is kind of nice. I think I was pessimistic, I'm always terribly pessimistic about something like that, I don't find it easy to be optimistic in such situations, and optimism, the optimism that I now have again for this person is only as qualified, I dare say. The poem is entitled ""A Lifetime"", and the more I thought about that word--I didn't get the title easily, I had to work it out--and the more I thought about that word, the more it began to mean to me. I think if you really think about that word, lifetime, as one word, it's very peculiar. And then I thought, I was thinking about time-life [audience laughter]. And that really, that was really funny. It's strange, isn't it, that those, that, that corporation should own those two words, as they do. It's very difficult to use them. We can't just call it--like, can you imagine putting out a magazine called Life? You know. Or Poetry magazine. These are very good names for a magazine. Or Time, you know. That's pretty big stuff! [Audience laughter]. What could they--and look what they've done with it, you know. So reduction is still possible [Laughter]. ""A Lifetime""...And one other thing [laughter] before I begin this one, it's not altogether this way, you've probably, you know, you've probably found that my lines, my poetry, has a tendency, especially in the earlier poems, to be, like they say, poetic, you know, to try to be a little, to try to sound pretty. It was something that meant a great deal to me earlier, and means a little less to me now than it did then, though beauty still means as much to me as ever. I have tried, I have looked for in my poetry--and one thing, it was very pleasant hearing Ron's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2165471] poems tonight, is a quality of voice, a quality of language, that doesn't necessarily try to be pretty at all--that tries to use the language that we are actually living with. I don't mean to try to talk about the old problems of prose and poetry, or anything of the kind. But just that, language needn't necessarily be quote, poetic, unquote. We had kind of a talk about that last night, at the reading in Ottawa, it was pretty funny. And this poem, just at least its beginning, it has that colloquialism that I enjoy.
 
Robert Hogg
00:35:37
Reads ""A Lifetime"".
 
Robert Hogg
00:37:03
And the last poem that I'd like to read is a poem that is really a freak poem. This poem has taken me at least two years to write, a little longer than two years to write, I think, and has been written over and over and over and over again, and like I said about time/life, this one has also suffered a phenomenal reduction, starting out as about six pages and ending up as three, which is usually a good sign. Originally there was a line in the poem, something about the presages of civilization, you know, are on my back or in my ear, or something like that, and it was a horrible line. Like a lot of the other lines it had to be excised, and rewritten, and so forth. But the thought of it, the thought of that word, the meaning of that word, contained, lived with me, and lived with my sense of the poem. And so I've entitled it simply, ""Presages"". And also, to make it a little more comprehensible, I've put a sort of bracket, subtitle, ""From a Sixth-Floor Apartment"". Actually, the poem was begun in Manhattan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11299], not in Manhattan, I'm sorry, in Queens [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18424], New York, when I was staying at my in-laws' house a little over two years ago, just briefly, and was written from their sixth-floor apartment. It actually, the strange thing about this poem is it was mostly written since then, really re-written, although the first part is pretty much as it was originally.

And so then I had this matter of the one you love coming to you and enabling you to be both light and dark elf to yourself, so that the two of you...whose particular form had never been, without her, it was that cultural attachment to particular forms, also, that I was hoping to tell the story, part of the story of, again, there.
